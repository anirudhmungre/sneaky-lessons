# Preprocessing Data with Functions for Plotly

In this activity, you will create functions that preprocess films from the Pagila database and create a bar chart of average values by age rating. 

## Instructions

* Using the [films.js](Unsolved/films.js) array of movies from the Pagila database, create a function that will calculate averages by age rating of one of the following metrics:

  * Rental rate (`rental_rate`)
  * Length (`length`)
  * Replacement cost (`replacement_cost`)

* With the calculated averages create a function that will generate a Plotly bar chart with the average values.

* After you have the functions working try changing the metric to update the bar chart.

## Hint

You will need to use conditionals, loops, and functions to complete this activity. You may find it helpful to review the following two activities: 

* [06-Stu_Iteration_and_Conditionals](../06-Stu_Iteration_and_Conditionals)

* [10-Stu_Creating-Functions](../10-Stu_Creating-Functions)
