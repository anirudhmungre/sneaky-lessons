# TV Ratings

In this activity, you will take some time to create an application that reads in a list of TV shows, makes multiple requests from an API to retrieve rating information, creates a pandas dataframe, and visually displays the data.

## Instructions

* Create an application that:
    
    * reads in a list of TV shows
    
    * makes multiple requests from an API to retrieve rating information
    
    * creates a Pandas DataFrame
    
    * visually displays the data.

* You may use the list of TV shows provided in the starter file or create your own.

* Request information on each TV show from the [TVmaze API's Show Search endpoint](https://www.tvmaze.com/api#show-search)
