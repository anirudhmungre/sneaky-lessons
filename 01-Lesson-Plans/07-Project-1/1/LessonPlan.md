* Students will be able to push local branches to GitHub.

## Instructor Prep

<details>
    <summary><strong>Instructor Notes</strong></summary>

* It is highly recommended to request project proposals from students and then approve their proposals. Students will often struggle with finding data sources and in setting realistic goals, so use this as an opportunity to guide them to unique, interesting, and achievable projects.

* Install the appropriate text editor plugin to help visualize Git histories: [Git History](https://github.com/DonJayamanne/gitHistoryVSCode) in VS Code, [Git Time Machine](https://github.com/pidu/git-timemachine) for Sublime Text, and [git-time-machine](https://atom.io/packages/git-time-machine) for Atom.

* Be sure to refer to the [TimeTracker](TimeTracker.xlsx) to remain on time.

* Please reference our [Student FAQ](../../../05-Instructor-Resources/README.md#unit-07-project-1) for answers to questions frequently asked by students of this program. If you have any recommendations for additional questions, feel free to log an issue or a pull request with your desired additions.

* Be sure to send out the [Git Branching Workflow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) before the end of class.

* Be sure to send out the [Visual Introduction to Git](https://medium.com/@ashk3l/a-visual-introduction-to-git-9fdca5d3b43a).

  * If possible, share the above links both _before_ today's class, and again at the end of it.

  * The Data Team is always on the lookout for awesome student projects. If one or more of the groups in your class submit an exceptional project that you feel would make a great example, please submit it using [the Data - Awesome Project Examples form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScWybmWGqZ0LLLG5MTfk2i1F484oxSFE93Kb2Nk0AslT4guiA/viewform?usp=sf_link)!

* Lastly, as a reminder these slideshows are for instructor use only - when distributing slides to students, please first export the slides to a PDF file. You may then send out the PDF file.

    <summary><strong>📣 1.2 Instructor Do: Intro to Git (0:30)</strong></summary>

* Open the [slideshow](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zJyEgc8TlJR43Vmti915aFX77J7Lx-vs6qsVj8Ja5-I/edit?usp=sharing) and use slides 4 - 7 to introduce Git.

* **Files:** [Activities/01-Ins_Workflows/README.md](Activities/01-Ins_Workflows/README.md)

* **N.b.**: If teaching with VS Code, consider using the [Git History](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.githistory) extension to illustrate this section's concents.

![Visualizing Git histories with the Git History plugin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DonJayamanne/gitHistoryVSCode/main/images/gitLogv2.gif)

* Open the [Introduction to Git](Activities/01-Ins_Workflows/README.md) for reference.

  * Have your TAs send this file out to students, as well.

* As a review, ask a student to explain what Git is.

  * Git is a tool for saving our work as we develop a project.

  * Git keeps track of our work over time.

* Explain that, whenever we get another piece of a project working, we can save the change with Git.

  * This "save" is called a **commit**, and represents a "checkpoint" for our project.

![A commit is a lot like a changelog note](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*zj-d8TopjgBml2QVM-672w.jpeg)

* Explain that, if we break something in our code while developing, this system allows us to restore the working code from before.

  * Since Git remembers these “checkpoints,” we can work on several different concerns all at once.

* Present the following scenario. For our project, let's say on transportation, we need to add an analysis of Uber rider data.

  * If we decide to analyze the average age of riders, Git essentially allows us to write this code, and save it with the name: `age_analysis`.

  * This code is _different_ from the code we started with, and that it lives separately from it.

  * In this scenario, we have a version of the code, called `main`, which is the "main" version of our code; and a version, called `age_analysis`, which contains updates.

  * `age_analysis` is a branch based on the `main` branch. That is, it adds or modifies code currently in the main branch.

* Explain that each version of the code lives on a different **branch**.

  * A **branch** is essentially a history of changes.

  * In this case, the `age_analysis` branch **diverged** from the `main` branch.

* Take a moment to discuss the benefits of having a separate branch for analyzing Uber rider data.

  * It gives our collaborators a chance to review the branch for errors and offer suggestions.

  * After the proposed change has been reviewed, we can update `main` branch to include the changes in `age_analysis` by doing a **merge**.

* Explain that **merging** two branches turns them into one.

  * This is how we can work on new features or bugfixes without affecting the main code.

  * When the code in the new branch (`age_analysis`) is merged, it becomes part of the main code (`main`).

  * Collaborators also avoid stepping on each other's toes by working on different branches.

* Finally, take a moment to review Git's "Snapshot model":

> “...Git thinks of its data more like a set of snapshots of a miniature filesystem. Every time you commit, or save the state of your project in Git, it basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot. To be efficient, if files have not changed, Git doesn’t store the file again, just a link to the previous identical file it has already stored. Git thinks about its data more like a stream of snapshots.”

    <summary><strong>🎉 1.3 Everyone Do: Creating a Project Repo (0:10)</strong></summary>

* Open the [slideshow](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zJyEgc8TlJR43Vmti915aFX77J7Lx-vs6qsVj8Ja5-I/edit?usp=sharing) and use slides 8 - 11 to introduce this activity.

* Explain that we'll next set up a GitHub repository that students can use for their projects.

* Instruct groups to choose _one_ member to follow along with you. This will be the repo that the group shares through projects.

* Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/), and click on the plus button in the top right to create a new repo.

  ![Creating a new repo on GitHub.](Images/03-add-repo.png)

  * Fill out the fields on the new repo page.

  * Students _should_ initialize with a `.gitignore`.

  * Students should choose `Python` in the gitignore dropdown.

  * Students should edit the `.gitignore` file and add:

  ``` python
  # DS_Store
  .DS_Store
  ```

  ![New project configuration.](Images/03-new-project.png)

  * This is sufficient to create a repository that everyone can share.

* Instruct students in charge of creating their group's repository to send the remote URL (i.e., the link to the repo) to their teammates.

  * Team members will `git clone` this link.

* Explain that, by default, only the creator of the repo can push changes.

* Show how to "open up" the repo by adding **collaborators**.

  * Navigate to the repository settings.

  ![Repository settings](Images/03-settings.png)

  * Navigate to the collaborators tab, and enter your password when prompted.

  ![Repository collaborators](Images/03-collaborators.png)

  * From here, students can search for their teammates by username.

  ![Adding collaborators](Images/03-add-collaborator.png)

  * Everyone in each group should now be able to make changes to the shared repo.

* Remind students again that _everyone in the group must clone the new repository_.

  * Make sure that everyone has done this before moving on.

    <summary><strong>🎉 2.1 Everyone Do: Creating Branches (0:10)</strong></summary>

* Open the [slideshow](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zJyEgc8TlJR43Vmti915aFX77J7Lx-vs6qsVj8Ja5-I/edit?usp=sharing) and use slides 15 and 16 to introduce this activity.

* **Files:**
  [Activities/03-Ins_Branches/Solved/BranchDemo.md](Activities/03-Ins_Branches/Solved/BranchDemo.md)

* Check for understanding before moving on.

  * Ask a student to explain the notion of branching.

  * Ask another student to provide two benefits of branching.

* Remind students to navigate into the project directory they just cloned from GitHub.

* Open up the [Branch Demo](Activities/03-Ins_Branches/Solved/BranchDemo.md) for reference.

* Step through each uncommented line in the demonstration.

  * Encourage your students to follow along with their own repositories.

* Explain that we first create a new file, and commit it on the `main` branch.

* Explain that we next create and **checkout** a new branch, on which to work on our data analysis.

  * Instruct students following along to add their name as a prefix when they create this branch, e.g.: `<student name>/data_analysis`.

* Explain that we can then commit files on this branch, _without affecting the code on `main`_.

  * To emphasize the point, ask a student to explain the difference between the code on `main` and that on `data_analysis`.

  * Instruct students to add and commit a text file containing their name to their new branch.

* Explain that, after working on the `data_analysis` branch, we can checkout main; update it with our changes to `data_analysis`; and then delete the `data_analysis` branch, if we don't plan to work on it anymore.

  * Point out that deleting branches like this isn't necessary.

* Take a moment to address any questions before moving on.

<details>
    <summary><strong>🎉 2.2 Everyone Do: Pushing to GitHub and Pulling Down Locally (0:10)</strong></summary>

* Open the [slideshow](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zJyEgc8TlJR43Vmti915aFX77J7Lx-vs6qsVj8Ja5-I/edit?usp=sharing) and use slides 17 - 19 to introduce this activity.

* Point out that, up until now, students' `data_analysis` branches aren't visible to their teammates—there's no way for their group members to see the work they've done.

* Explain that, in order to share work we do on branches, we can **push** code to from our computers to GitHub, after which our teammates can **pull** it from GitHub to their computers.

* Explain that there are two steps to push our local branch to GitHub.

* First, checkout the branch we want to push to GitHub

* Then, run: `git push origin <branch_name>`

  * Instruct the class to run this line to push their local branches to their shared repository.

* Explain that we have now pushed our local branch to GitHub, allowing our teammates to get access to it later.

* Explain that similarly, if our teammates push up branches, or changes to branches on the GitHub repo, we can pull these changes down to our local computers quickly and easily.

* After everyone has pushed to GitHub, instruct the class to checkout main, and then:

  * First, run `git pull`

  * Then, run `git checkout <branch_name>`, where `<branch_name>` is the name of one of their teammates' branches.

  * Give students a minute or two to verify that the code they checked out does indeed come from their teammate's branch.

* Point out that this allows us to easily share different versions of our code across workstations, and allows us to easily test those versions on our local computers.

* **Slides 22-24** Use the slides to review the schedule for the next two weeks. Remind them that sticking to the schedule will greatly aid in their success!

* **Slides 25-27** Using the slides again as a reference, briefly cover the development and presentation requirements.

* **Slides 28-29** Explain that this project uses a rubric to assess each team's success with the tasks provided. Share a copy of the rubric with the students and encourage them to reference it often as they work on development.

  * Share the [Project 1 Rubric  - EDA and Git Collaboration](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fPa8EXPb5caZyzG2EdhzyWyhta9jC62siFMctNCvKog/edit?usp=sharing) with the class so they can keep a copy of the rubric locally and reference it as needed.

* **Slides 30-31** Discuss with the class the many different data sources available to them. Encourage them not to take too long deciding which data to use or topic to research.

* **Slides 32-42** Explain to the class that this project has the option to choose a specific specialization track: healthcare or finance. If teams would rather persue a custom track, that's fine too!

* **Slides 34-36** Briefly explain to the class that EDA in finance is necessary for many tasks! Use the next few slides to examine how an Equity Trader and Financial Analyst would each utilize these skills.

* **Slides 37-39** Explain that different professions within the healthcare field also employ EDA in their work.

* **Slides 41-42** There are several other fields utilizing EDA as well, such as individuals working in the law enforcement field, or using data to predict an uptick in ride sharing usage.

* **Slides 43-45** Take a moment to remind students of their objectives for today before diving them into their teams to begin project work.

* Take a moment to address any remaining student questions before dismissing the class for break.
