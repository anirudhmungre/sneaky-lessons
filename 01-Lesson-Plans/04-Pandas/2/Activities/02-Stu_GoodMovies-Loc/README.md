# Good Movies

In this activity, you will create an application that searches through IMDb data to find only the best movies out there.

## Instructions

* Use Pandas to load and display the CSV provided in `Resources`.

* List all the columns in the dataset.

* We're only interested in IMDb data, so create a new table that takes the film and all the columns related to IMDb.

* Filter out only the good movies&mdash;any film with an IMDb score greater than or equal to 7&mdash;and remove the norm ratings.

* Find less popular movies that you may not have heard about&mdash;anything with under 20K votes.

* Finally, export this file to a spreadsheet, excluding the index, so we can keep track of our future watchlist.
