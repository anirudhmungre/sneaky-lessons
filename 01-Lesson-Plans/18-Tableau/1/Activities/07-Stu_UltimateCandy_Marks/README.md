# The Ultimate Candy

You will now take some time to create charts that compare candies against one-another. The charts themselves are quite basic but will be made more complex using marks.

## Instructions

* Create a pair of bar graphs that chart the win percent of each candy, then color the bars according to whether they are fruity and/or chocolatey.

* Create a scatter plot comparing the sugar percentage against the win percentage. Color the points based upon whether they are chocolatey and size them according to price.

* Create one more scatter plot comparing the sugar percentage against the win percentage. Color the points based upon whether they are fruity and size them according to price.
