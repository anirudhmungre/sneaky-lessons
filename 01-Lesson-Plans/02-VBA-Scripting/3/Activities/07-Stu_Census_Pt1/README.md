# U.S. Census, Part 1

In this first part of the activity, you will create a VBA script that loops through the sheets in the workbook and formats each one to be more readable.

## Instructions

1. Extract the number before the phrase "\_census_data" to figure out the year.

2. Add the year to the first column of each spreadsheet.

3. Split the "Place" column into "County" and "State".

4. Convert the household and per capita income columns to currency values for all cells.

## Hints

  * First, try to get the formatting right on one sheet before creating a loop that formats each sheet within your workbook.

  * If you’d like a helpful resource about looping through all worksheets in a workbook, check out this [documentation](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/142126/macro-to-loop-through-all-worksheets-in-a-workbook).
