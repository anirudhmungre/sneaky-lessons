# Mapping

In this activity, you will create arrays using the `map` function with the following princess dataset:

```javascript
princesses = [
    { name: "Rapunzel", age: 18 },
    { name: "Mulan", age: 16 },
    { name: "Anna", age: 18 },
    { name: "Moana", age: 16 }
  ];
```

## Instructions

* Create an array of just the names from the princesses array.

* Create an array of strings for each princess name, follow by a colon, followed by their age.

## Bonus 

* Create the array of strings using an arrow function instead.

## Hint

* Don't forget to use dot notation to access the values for the object keys.
