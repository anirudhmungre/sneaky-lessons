# Unit 19: Supervised Machine Learning

## Overview

This week's class will begin our exploration of machine learning, focusing on supervised machine learning models. 

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this unit, you'll be able to: 

* Explain how data analytics uses machine learning algorithms.
* Create training and testing sets from a specified data set.
* Implement linear and logistic regressions by using scikit-learn.
* Create confusion matrixes for classification outputs.
* Calculate and apply fundamental classification algorithms: logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), and k-nearest neighbors (KNN).
* Quantify and validate classification models by using confusion matrixes.
* Implement one-hot encoding in Pandas and scaling and normalization with scikit-learn.
* Calculate and apply bagging and boosting methods to create and use ensemble algorithms.
* Apply regularization parameters for regressions and select the appropriate parameters for a specified problem.
* Use Random Forests and LASSO regressions to aid the feature selection process.
