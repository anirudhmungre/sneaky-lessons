# Career Connection

Welcome back to another Career Connection! This week you explored big data, Spark, NLP, and cloud computing using Amazon Web Services.

A quick Google search will show you that careers in big data and NLP are on the rise. That means we need more people with these skills entering the workforce as soon as possible—and that’s good news for you.

First things first, let’s tackle those employer-competitive tasks that will help you get noticed by prospective employers.

- Build Your Visibility
  - Attend one to two local Meetups or Eventbrite events in the next couple of weeks. You can find groups specializing in big data or NLP, or you can discuss data visualization topics in general.

- Improve Your Skills
  - It might be a little early to start learning AWS in depth (you have a lot of coursework already!), but check out the [AWS Training and Certification](https://aws.amazon.com/training/) page to get a glimpse of what AWS offers.

## Technical Interview

You might know the answer to those questions we discussed in class, but others you’ll need to research. Either way, try to discover the answers for yourself before looking at our answer key. This will aid you in remembering the answers.  

This is by no means an exhaustive list of questions you might see in an interview; it’s just a sampling of the types of things you could be expected to know. If you’re unsure of the answers, look them up online or in the module material.

**Q: Define big data and the Four Vs of big data.**

- At its core, big data is a collection of unstructured or semi-structured datasets:

  - Volume
  - Variety
  - Velocity
  - Veracity

**Q: How is Hadoop related to big data?**

- Hadoop is an open-source framework for storing data and running applications on clusters. It offers massive storage for all sorts of data, processing power, and the ability to handle concurrent tasks.

Now that you’re done tackling these, do an online search for common big data interview questions and jot down the questions and answers.

### Case Study

> Megamart is the largest retailer in the world, and by the measure of revenue, also the largest company the world has ever seen. With more than 2.5 million employees and some 25,000 stores in 25-plus countries around the world, it has been essential to utilize big data analytics to discover patterns that help drive revenue, increase customer satisfaction, and correctly target customers with product recommendations.
>
> The main objective of Megamart is to optimize the shopping experience of customers when they are in a Megamart store or visiting the online website.

1. What tools would you recommend implementing to best manage their big data datasets?

2. What problems do you anticipate a company of this size having when engaging with big data?

3. What process would you go through when selecting a new tool or technology for Megamart, as opposed to just selecting something you are familiar or comfortable with?
