# Career Connection

Welcome back to Career Connection! On behalf of the career team, congratulations on making it through the second week of boot camp. This week you added Visual Basic for Applications to your skill set! 

## The Current State of VBA

Maybe you’ve poked around on the internet and seen people asking “is it worth learning VBA?” or even “when will VBA stop working?”. It’s natural to ask whether a certain technology is still current or still valuable. Now that we’re data professionals, let’s consider some facts to answer these questions, and then search for data to give us an answer.

So why would we keep learning VBA today?

- You don’t need to leave Excel to use it…
  - Since VBA is bundled with Excel, you can enhance your analysis within Excel by just adding a macro. With just a few lines of code we can manipulate large amounts of data, create UIs, and even grab data from the Internet.
- Extensive Documentation...
  - VBA has been around a long time, and there is a large amount of documentation and help available to us. Many companies are heavy Excel or Word users, and VBA is right there ready for us to implement!
- Companies are still hiring VBA developers...
  - Yep! There are still many, many jobs available for VBA skill sets. We’ll dig into that in just a little bit here.
- So many companies rely on it…
  - Many companies are still using it and are invested in it, meaning that it’s not going anywhere any time soon

VBA may not have been a skill you were expecting to learn, but believe it or not, there is a lucrative market of jobs available for this skill. Let’s take a look at the data:

## Look to the Future

Head over to [Indeed.com](http://Indeed.com) and drop VBA into the “What” field, and your current location (or the location you want to work in) into the “Where” field.  Here’s an example:

You can see that by dropping VBA into New York, there were 536 related positions at the time of writing. Of course, demand will vary depending on where you are, the market needs etc., but the point here is that even after just the second week in class, you have marketable skills that are valuable and wanted by future prospective employers!

But how much can you cash those skills in for? After all, you’re likely not planning to work for free. Well, the good news is that demand for VBA programmers is high enough that it carries a decent price tag. Again, remember that salary averages can and do fluctuate from market to market, and even vary depending on the size of the company you’re working for, whether it’s private or public sector among other things. But a report by salaryexpert.com reveals that VBA programmers can expect to make about $90,000 on average:

## Technical Interview

Many companies use algorithm questions during the technical interview. We’ll start diving into those when we learn Python. For VBA, consider the following common technical interview questions.

Try to answer each question without looking at class material or the Internet first.

- Can you explain to me what VBA is?
  - VBA is Visual Basic for Applications, a programming language developed by Microsoft and predominantly used with Microsoft Office applications like Word and Excel.

- Using VBA, how would you declare variable and constant?
  - Variable is declared with the keyword “DIM” while constants are declared with “CONST.”

- How would you go about debugging VBA code?
  - Using breakpoints
  - Step-by-step execution
  - Print and Immediate Window and Watch

When you've answered these questions on your own, search the internet to check your answers or check out our own suggestions.
