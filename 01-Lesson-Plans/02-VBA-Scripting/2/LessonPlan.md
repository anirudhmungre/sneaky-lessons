# 2.2 Control Flow with VBA

## Overview

In today's class, students will learn to use basic and nested `for` loops together with conditionals to perform common coding tasks in VBA.

## Class Objectives

By the end of this lesson, the students will be able to: 

* Describe the basic syntax of a VBA `for` loop.
* Use `for` loops and conditionals to direct logic flow.
* Explain the value and basics of using nested `for` loops.
* Refine their fundamental coding skills: syntax recollection, pattern recognition, problem decomposition, and debugging.

## Instructor Prep

<details>
  <summary><strong>Instructor Notes</strong></summary>

* Today is a fun but challenging class. Students will complete a series of programming challenges in VBA. As with many classes to come, today is an exercise-heavy lesson. The class should feel lively, as students may struggle through challenges and experience many "light bulb" moments. Do your part to facilitate this atmosphere, and encourage active dialogue within groups.

* Since today's class contains many exercises, your time behind the podium should feel minimal. Instead, regularly circulate the class, and bring your teaching to the students in their seats. This approach will help you tailor your teaching to the needs of specific students.

* As with the previous class, it is important to stress that today's exercises exemplify fundamental programming concepts across languages. At times, you may hear students express frustration with VBA. If so, help reframe their thinking. Tell them that their frustration is normal, as this lesson will have them tackle increasingly complex problems that combine multiple fundamental concepts.

* Have your TAs refer to the [Time Tracker](TimeTracker.xlsx) to stay on track.

* Please reference our [Student FAQ](../../../05-Instructor-Resources/README.md#unit-02-vba-scripting) for answers to questions frequently asked by students of this program. If you have any recommendations for additional questions, feel free to log an issue or a pull request with your desired additions.

* Finally, as a reminder, these slideshows are **for instructor use only**; when distributing slides to students, please first export the slides to a PDF file. You may then distribute the PDF file to students.

<details>
  <summary><strong>üì£ 1.1 Instructor Do: Welcome Students (0:05)</strong></summary>

* Spend a few moments welcoming students. Let them know that in today's class, we'll be ‚Äúripping off the band-aid.‚Äù They'll spend the majority of class working on exercises designed to build their programming skills.

* If you'd like, feel free to use this [slideshow](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HpP3Hb3HnYJ4nldADC1SU2hbLGlgtiWsJa6iSP1NY-Q/edit?usp=sharing) to kick off class with some warm-ups.

  <summary><strong>üë• 1.2 Partners Do: Warm-up Activity (Budget Checker) (0:15)</strong></summary>

* Direct students to the warm-up activity. In this activity, students will work in pairs to create a script that calculates a total price, including fees, and then corrects the initial price if the total is over budget, as in the following image:

![Images/01-Stu_Warmup_1.png](Images/01-Stu_Warmup_1.png)

* Demonstrate to students how the solved code should work, then have your TAs send out the unsolved file and the instructions:

  * **Files:**

    * [BudgetChecker](Activities/01-Stu_Warmup/Unsolved/budget_checker.xlsm)
    * [README](Activities/01-Stu_Warmup/README.md)

  * **Instructions:**

    * Create a VBA script to complete the budget checker.

    * There are three parts to this problem.

      * Part 1: Calculate the total amount after adding in the fee, and enter the value in the ‚ÄúTotal‚Äù cell.

      * Part 2: Create a message box to alert the user if the total amount is within or over budget.

      * Part 3 (the challenge): If the total is over budget, correct the price so it falls within the user‚Äôs budget. Be sure to round down! For example, if the user's budget is 100 and the fees are 15%, the max price should be 86.

    * **Hints:**

      * Break up the problem into smaller steps.

      * Look at old code! You got this!

  <summary><strong>‚≠ê 1.3 Review: Warm-Up (Budget Checker) (0:10)</strong></summary>

* **File:** [Activities/01-Stu_Warmup/Solved/budget_checker.vbs](Activities/01-Stu_Warmup/Solved/budget_checker.vbs)

* Once time is up, review the solution to the previous exercise. As you do so, encourage students to explain to you what is happening in the code.

* While discussing Part 1, be sure to point out the following:

  * First, we created a variable called `total` (as a `double`) to hold our full cost.

  * Next, we combined the `price` and `(1 + tax)` to calculate the full cost.

  * Finally, we entered the final cost into the `total` cell.

```vb
  ' Part 1
  ' ----------------------------------------------------

  ' 1. Retrieve the Price and Fees from the cells
  Dim total As Double

  ' 2. Use these values to calculate the total
  total = Range("F3").Value * (1 + Range("H3").Value)
  ' MsgBox(total)

  ' 3. Enter the total into the appropriate cell
  Range("L3").Value = total
```

* While discussing Part 2, be sure to point out the following:

  * First, we created a variable called `budget` to hold our budget amount.

  * We then compared the value of our budget against `total`.

  * If the budget was greater than the total, we displayed a message that we were under budget. If the budget was less than the total, the message stated that we were over budget.

```vb
  ' Part 2
  ' ----------------------------------------------------
  ' 4. Create a variable to store budget
  Dim budget As Double
  budget = Range("B3").Value
  ' msgbox(budget)

  ' 5. Compare using conditionals whether total is greater than or less than the budget
  If budget > total Then

      MsgBox ("Under budget")

  Else

      MsgBox ("Over budget")
  End If
```

* While discussing Part 3, be sure to point out the following:

  * First, we had to use algebra to determine our formula for the new price. In this case, the new price was equal to `budget` divided by `(1 + tax)`.

  * We then stored the new price in a variable and used it with the tax to calculate the new total.

  * We rounded the new price down to the nearest whole dollar using a `WorksheetFunction`. This method allows users to access many of the functions available in Excel. `RoundDown(newPrice, 0)` stipulates that we're rounding down the `newPrice` variable and that we're not including any digits past the decimal.

  ```vb
  'Use a worksheet function to round the new price down to the nearest whole dollar
  newPrice = Application.WorksheetFunction.RoundDown(newPrice, 0)
  ```

  * Finally, we changed the price and the total in the appropriate cells.

```vb
  ' Part III
  ' ----------------------------------------------------
  Dim newPrice As Double
  newPrice = budget / (1 + Range("H3").Value)

  ' Change the price
  Range("F3").Value = newPrice

  ' Change the new total
  Range("L3").Value = newPrice * (1 + Range("H3").Value)
```

* Ask if there are any questions before providing students with the solution and proceeding to the next section.

  * [Activities/02-Ins_ForLoops/basic_for_loop.xlsm](Activities/02-Ins_ForLoops/Solved/basic_for_loop.xlsm)

* Next, you'll be introducing `for` loops. Guide students through the code, and run the VBA script. This code simply inserts a series of numbers across rows and columns.

* While explaining the code, be sure to note the parts of a VBA `for` loop:

  * `For i = 1 to 20` specifies the range to loop through.

  * Subsequent uses of `i` change with the loop.

  * `Next i` iterates to the next value of `i`.

  * **Note**: While semantic variable declaration is more prevalent, `i` is deliberately chosen here because it has been commonly used in programming for decades; it is also the default mathematical notation. Students will encounter iterators such as `i` and `j` both later in the course and when they land a job in the field.

* During your discussion, spend a few moments having students guess how the spreadsheet will look once you run the code. In particular, challenge them to understand why `Cells(i, 1)` creates entries across rows and `Cells(1, i)` creates entries across columns.

```vb
    ' Create a variable to hold the counter
    Dim i As Integer

    ' Loop through from numbers 1 through 20
    For i = 1 To 20
    
        ' Iterate through the rows placing a value of 1 throughout
        Cells(i, 1).Value = 1
    
        ' Iterate through the columns placing a value of 5 throughout 
        Cells(1, i).Value = 5

        ' Places increasing values based upon the variable "i" in B2 to B21
        Cells(i + 1, 2).Value = i + 1
    
    ' Call the next iteration
    Next i
```

* Once you feel confident in their understanding, provide them with your code.

* Demonstrate to students what happens after the code runs, then send them the instructions.

* **Instructions:**

  * Create a `for` loop that will produce the following example. Note that the lines represent new cells.

    | A1         | B1 | C1              |
    |----------|:-------------:|------:|
    | I will eat | 11 | Chicken Nuggets |

* Once the time is up, review the exercise with students, and be sure to cover the following points:

  * We created a `for` loop that iterates from 1 through 10.

  * We set the values of `(i, 1)` and `(i, 3)` to be fixed values of "I will eat " and "Chicken Nuggets".

  * We set the value of `(i, 2)` to be `i +10`. This forces the loop to print 11 through 20.

  * Finally, we use `Next i` to signal that we are done with the loop and on to the next one.

```vb
    ' Loop through first 10 rows
    For i = 1 To 10

        ' Set values in column 1 to "I will eat"
        Cells(i, 1).Value = "I will eat "

        ' Set values in column 2 to the sum of the counter + 10 
        Cells(i, 2).Value = i + 10

    Next i
```

* Next, introduce one of this week‚Äôs most important concepts: **looped conditionals**. As a proficient developer, you‚Äôll find this concept simple and intuitive, but do not underestimate how difficult it can be for students.

* Open [Activities/04-Ins_LoopConditionals/Solved/modulus.vbs](Activities/04-Ins_LoopConditionals/Solved/modulus.vbs), and explain that the modulus essentially performs long division on a number and returns the remainder. Note that in VBA, modulus is denoted by `Mod`. Run the code in [Activities/04-Ins_LoopConditionals/Solved/modulus.xlsm](Activities/04-Ins_LoopConditionals/Solved/modulus.xlsm).

* Then, open [Activities/04-Ins_LoopConditionals/Solved/conditional_loops.vbs](Activities/04-Ins_LoopConditionals/Solved/conditional_loops.vbs), and guide students through the code. Have them guess what it will do before running the code.

* Then, explain it line by line.

  * Start by pointing out the basic `for` loop structure.

  * Then, introduce the concept of the modulus to determine the remainder.

  * Point out that we are using `if-else` statements to route the flow of logic depending on whether `i` is even or odd.

  * Point out that we need to include the `End If` and also the `Next i` to close each respective block.

```vb
    ' Create a for loop from 1 to 10
    For i = 1 To 10

        ' Use the modulus function to determine if a number is divisible by 2 (even number)
        If Cells(i, 1).Value Mod 2 = 0 Then

            ' Enter "Even Row" the adjacent cell
            Cells(i, 2).Value = "Even Row"
            
        ' If the number is not divisible by 2 (odd number)
        Else

            ' Enter "Even Row" the adjacent cell
            Cells(i, 2).Value = "Odd Row"
            
        ' Close the If/Else Statement

* The following image captures the results of running the code:

![Images/05-Stu_FizzBuzz-1.png](Images/05-Stu_FizzBuzz-1.png)

* Explain the rules of the exercise at a high level:

  * If a number is divisible by just 3, then the code should print ‚ÄúFizz‚Äù.

  * If a number is divisible by just 5, then the code should print ‚ÄúBuzz‚Äù.

  * If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, then the code should print ‚ÄúFizzbuzz‚Äù.

* Then, send students the instructions to the exercise:

* **Instructions:**

  * Create a VBA script that populates the second column with the word "Fizz", "Buzz", or "Fizzbuzz" based on the value in the first column.

  * If the value in Column 1 is a multiple of both 3 and 5, print "Fizzbuzz" in Column 2.

  * If the value in Column 1 is a multiple of just 3, print "Fizz" in Column 2.

  * If the value in Column 1 is a multiple of just 5, print "Buzz" in Column 2.

* Then, guide students through the solution, and be sure to cover the following points:

  * We started the exercise by creating a basic `for` loop.

  * We then created a variable to track the value of the number in Column 1.

  * We then created a series of `if-then` statements. To begin, we checked for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5. It is important to start here because `if-then` statements move from least specific to most specific (i.e., if a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, it is also divisible by 3. We have to make sure our code handles the more specific scenario first). Let students know that this isn't an obvious solution, but rather something that becomes clear as you work through your code.

  * Each of our `if-then` statements triggers a change to `Cells(i, 2)` (Column 2).

```vb
  ' Loop through the values in Column 1
  For i = 2 To 100

      'Set cell value to variable
      num = Cells(i, 1).Value


      ' Check if the number is divisible by 3 and 5....
      If (num Mod 3 = 0 And num Mod 5 = 0) Then

          ' If so, print Fizzbuzz
          Cells(i, 2).Value = "Fizzbuzz"

      ' Check if the number is divisible by just 3...

* Once students return, introduce the next exercise. Let them know that it's a challenging one, but also encourage them to have fun with it. In this exercise, students are provided with a series of winning lotto tickets. Their task is to create a VBA script that finds these lotto winners in the list of all ticket purchases. For the bonus, they need to find the first time a runner-up lotto ticket appears in the list..

* Demonstrate what the code does by running it in VBA. Point out that the winners in the winner table match what you'd find if you used `Ctrl+F` to search for the same numbers. The following image captures the winner table, including first and last names and winning numbers.

![Images/06-Stu_Lotto-1.png](Images/06-Stu_Lotto-1.png)

## Instructions

* The winning tickets are:

  * First place: 3957481
  * Second place: 5865187
  * Third place: 2817729

* Create a script that will return those lucky winners and print them on the sheet.

  * For each winner, include the following pieces of information:

    * First name
    * Last name
    * The winning number

  * Present the winners in order: first place, then second place, then third place.

  * There should also be a message box that congratulates the first-place winner.

## Bonus

A last-minute consolation prize was added! Three wild ticket numbers were generated. Search for the following tickets to find the fourth-place (runner-up) winner. The first player to hold any one of these tickets is the runner-up.

  * 2275339
  * 5868182
  * 1841402

## Hint

* Remember to use variables to keep your code clean.

* For the bonus, you may need to use `Exit For`.

  * [Activities/06-Stu_Lotto-AdvancedForLoops/Solved/lotto_numbers.vbs](Activities/06-Stu_Lotto-AdvancedForLoops/Solved/lotto_numbers.vbs)

* Once time is up, guide students through the solution:

  * We began by creating a series of variables to hold our ticket numbers and winner information. Because the ticket numbers are so long, we needed to use `double` or `long`. Explain to students that these alternative formats allow for longer numbers, and we‚Äôre using these different variable types to save space.

```vb
    ' Create variables to hold winners. (Use "Long" because the numbers exceed the limit for integers) 
    Dim first_place As Long
    Dim second_place As Long
    Dim third_place As Long
    Dim runner1 As Long
    Dim runner2 As Long
    Dim runner3 As Long

    ' Establish the winning ticket numbers
    first_place = 3957481
    second_place = 5865187
    third_place = 2817729

    ' Establish the runner-up numbers
    runner1 = 2275339
    runner2 = 5868182
    runner3 = 1841402
```

* Next, point out that we then created a `for` loop to scan through each row. All the while, our code is searching for instances when the value in Column 3 (`Cells(i, 3)`) matches the value of our first-, second-, or third-place winners. If there is a match, we copy the winner's first name, last name, and ticket information, and we place them into the winner table (`Cells(2,6)` - `Cells(4,8)`).

```vb
    ' Loop through each of the lotto tickets
    For i = 1 To 1001

        ' Check if the lotto number matches the first place winner...
        If Cells(i, 3).Value = first_place Then

            ' If so, create a message box specifying the first place win
            MsgBox " Congratulations " + Cells(i, 1).Value

            ' Retrieve the values associated with the winner and enter them into the winner's box.
            Cells(2, 6).Value = Cells(i, 1).Value
            Cells(2, 7).Value = Cells(i, 2).Value
            Cells(2, 8).Value = first_place

        ' Check if the lotto number matches the second place winner...
        ElseIf Cells(i, 3).Value = second_place Then
            
            ' Retrieve the values associated with the winner and enter them into the winner's box.
            Cells(3, 6).Value = Cells(i, 1).Value
            Cells(3, 7).Value = Cells(i, 2).Value
            Cells(3, 8).Value = second_place
```

* Finally, for the bonus, we needed to create a second, _separate_ `for` loop because our current `for` loop will replace our runner-up winner with the last instance instead of the first instance. To avoid replacing our runner-up, we needed to create a `for` loop with an `Exit for`, which would exit the loop the moment the first runner up is found.

```vb
    ' Loop through the lotto tickets a second time to find the first instance of a "runner-up" winner

* Proceed now to the final instructor demo: Nested for-loops. Like looped conditionals, this is an extremely important concept and one that leaves students easily confused. Encourage them to focus on this section.

* Walk students through the spreadsheet and code. Point out that in this example, we are looking to loop through both the rows and columns. Try to highlight cells as you try to simulate the actions of each loop. Begin at the top left, move across the columns, before proceeding to the next row.

* Encourage students to re-do this process themselves to one another before moving on to the next exercise.

* Finally, introduce the last exercise of the day: Crypto Kennel. This is a fun exercise, but another challenging one. In essence the problem of this exercise is as follows:

  * You have been given a spreadsheet that's full of animal inspired cryptocurrency.

  * In Part I, you are responsible for counting the number of times `Cat Token` appears.

  * In Part II, you are responsible for replacing all instances of the word `Cat Token` with the word `Dogecoin`.

  * In Part III, you are given a set number of `Shiba Inu` and `Dogecoin`. Each time you replace a `Cat Token` with a `Shiba Inu` or `Dogecoin`, you are deducting from your supply. You must replace as many instances of `Cat Token` as you can and indicate whether all the `Cat Token` appearances have been replaced.

* Run the code [Activities/08-Stu_CryptoKennel-NestedForLoops/Solved/crypto_kennel-solved.xlsm](Activities/08-Stu_CryptoKennel-NestedForLoops/Solved/crypto_kennel-solved.xlsm) to show students what the code does. (Note: Do not save over your file as the macro will overwrite the contents.)

![Images/08-Stu_CryptoKennel-1.png](Images/08-Stu_CryptoKennel-1.png)

* Then send the instructions and initial file:

  * **Instructions:**

    * Create a VBA script to handle the over-abundance of the `Cat Token` currency in your spreadhseet's "crypto kennel".

    * There are three parts to this problem:

      * **Part 1:** Count the number of times `Cat Token` appears and display the number to your user in the form of a message box.

      * **Part 2:** Modify the script such that it changes the word `Cat Token` to `Dogecoin`.

      * **Part 3:** Modify the script a third time, this time keeping in mind that you have a limited number of `Shiba Inu` and `Dogecoin`. Use the full set of `Shiba Inu` and `Dogecoin` you have available to replace all instances of `Cat Token`. If you run out of `Shiba Inu` or `Dogecoin` provide the user with the message: "Oh no! We still have some Cat Token..."

  * **Hints**
 
    * You may want to create a backup of your spreadsheet as your macro will write over the contents.

* Once the timer completes, review the solution with the group.

* In discussing Part 1, point out that we utilized a simple nested for loop to search for the term "Cat Token" in each of the cells. In Part 2, we subsequently change the value of these cells to be "Dogecoin".

  ![Images/08-Stu_CryptoKennel-2.png](Images/08-Stu_CryptoKennel-2.png)

* In Part 3, we had the added challenge of continually tracking our `Shiba Inu` and `Dogecoin` count. The easiest way to approach this problem was to draw from our `Shiba Inu` stash first and then once depleted to draw from our `Dogecoin` stash. In essence, this code works by storing our initial `Shiba Inu` and `Dogecoin` count, then continually subtracting one from these variables each time we utilized either. Once the `Shiba Inu` and `Dogecoin` count is equal to 0, we can no longer draw from that stash.

  ![Images/08-Stu_CryptoKennel-3.png](Images/08-Stu_CryptoKennel-3.png)

* For the last requirement of Part 3, we deftly avoided the for loop completely. Instead, we concluded if there were any instances of `Cat Token` unaccounted for by comparing the sum of `Shiba Inu` and `Dogecoin` to the initial number of `Cat Token`. If there were more appearances of `Cat Token` than `Shiba Inu` and `Dogecoin` to start, then we know there are still instances of `Cat Token` after our replacement efforts. Take a moment to explain to students that creative thinking like this is often the real skill in programming.
