### Career Connection

Each week, students will review a Career Connection document in the [04-Career-Modules folder](../../04-Career-Modules/). This Career Connection relates this week's material to a professional setting, encourages students to complete certain career-focused tasks, and provides technical interviewing questions, where applicable, that the students can work through.

**If you haven't already done so, remember to push this entire folder for students to access.**

Remind the students that related career resources can be found in this supplemental folder.
