# Exploring Census Data

In this activity, you will revisit the U.S. Census data and create DataFrames with calculated totals and averages for each state by year.

## Instructions

1. Read in the census CSV file with Pandas.

2. Create two new DataFrames, one to find totals and another to find averages. DataFrames should include:

    * Totals for population, employed civilians, unemployed civilians, people in the military, and poverty count.

    * Averages for median age, household income, and per capita income.

3. Create new DataFrames once the totals and averages have been grouped by each year and state.

4. Rename any columns to reflect the data calculations.

5. Export the resulting tables to CSVs. We will be using them again in our next class.
