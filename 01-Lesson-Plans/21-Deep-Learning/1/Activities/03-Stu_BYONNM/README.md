# Bring Your Own Neural Network Model

In this activity, you'll be using a neural network model to classify the data from `make_blobs`.

**Instructions:**

  * Using the starter code provided, visualize the blobs dummy dataset using a Pandas scatter plot.

  * Randomly split the dummy data into training and test datasets using Scikit-learn's `train_test_split` method.

  * Normalize both datasets using Scikit-learn's `StandardScaler` class.

  * Create a basic neural network with five neurons in the hidden layer using the Keras module.

    * **Note:** Your neural network should use two inputs and produce one classification output.

  * Compile your basic neural network model.

  * Train the neural network model over 50 epochs.

  * Evaluate the performance of your model, printing your test loss metric and the predictive accuracy of the model on the test dataset.

  **Bonus:**

  * Try creating a new neural network with a different number of neurons.

  * Train the new neural network model on the same training data and test the performance on the same testing dataset.

  * Create a line plot that visualizes the neural network predictive accuracy over each epoch.
