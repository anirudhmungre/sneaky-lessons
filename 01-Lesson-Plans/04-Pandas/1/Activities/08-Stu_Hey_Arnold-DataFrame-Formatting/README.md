# Hey Arnold!

In this activity, you will take a premade DataFrame of “Hey Arnold!” characters and reorganize it so that it is easier to understand. 

## Instructions

Use Pandas to create a DataFrame with the following columns and values:

* “Character_in_show”: Arnold, Gerald, Helga, Phoebe, Harold, Eugene

* “color_of_hair”: blonde, black, blonde, black, unknown, red

* “Height”: average, tallish, tallish, short, tall, short

* “Football_Shaped_Head”: True, False, False, False, False, False

Note that the column names are inconsistent and difficult to work with. Rename them to the following, respectively:

* “Character”, “Hair Color”, “Height”, “Football Head”

Create a new table that contains all of the columns in the following order:

* “Character”, “Football Head”, “Hair Color”, “Height”
