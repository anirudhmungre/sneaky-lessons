# Number Chain

In this activity, you will take user input and print out a string of numbers.

## Instructions

* Using a `while` loop, ask the user "How many numbers?", and then print out a chain of numbers in increasing order, from 0 to the user-input number.

* After the results have been printed, ask the user if they would like to continue.

    * If "y" is entered, keep the chain running by inputting a new number and starting a new count from 0 to the new user-input number. 

    * If "n" is entered, exit the application.

## Bonus

Rather than just displaying numbers starting from 0, have the numbers begin at the end of the previous chain.
