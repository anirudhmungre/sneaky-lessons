# Movie Score Looping

In this activity, you will create a for loop, append values into arrays based on the movie's decade, calculate the average rating of all movies, and print out how many of the top 10 movies came from each decade.

## Instructions

In this activity, given a list of movie objects, you will:

* Append the movies into arrays based on the movie's decade.

* Calculate the average rating of all movies.

* Print how many of the top 10 movies came from each decade.

## Hint

* For more information about how to push elements to an empty array, review [02-Ins_JavaScript-Variables_and_Data_Structures](../02-Ins_JavaScript-Variables_and_Data_Structures). 

*  To find the length of the array, review the [JavaScript Array documentation](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_length_array.asp) from W3Schools.
