# Detecting diabetes

In this activity, you'll use a deep learning model to predict if a person has diabetes.

## Instructions

* Upload the [starter notebook](Unsolved\DetectingDiabetes.ipynb) to Google Colab and run the code to import the dependencies and load the diabetes dataset.

* Separate the diabetes **Outcome** target from the other features in the dataset.

* Split the features and target into training and test datasets.

* Preprocess the input data accordingly:

  * If preprocessing categorical data, use Scikit-learn's **OneHotEncoder** module.
  * If preprocessing numerical data, use Scikit-learn's **StandardScaler** module.

* Define a deep learning model with the following features:

  * A first Dense layer with eight inputs and the "ReLU" activation function
  * A second Dense layer with at least eight neurons and the "ReLU" activation function
  * An output layer with one neuron and the "sigmoid" activation function

* Compile and train the model across no more than 100 epochs.

* Evaluate the performance of the deep learning model by calculating the test loss and predictive accuracy.
