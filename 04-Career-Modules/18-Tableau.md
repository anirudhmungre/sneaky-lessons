# Career Connection

Welcome back to another Career Connection! This week you explored Tableau, a data analysis tool that is used throughout the data visualization world. In fact, it’s so popular because it allows us to create materials that are simple and straightforward enough for nontechnical audiences like recruiters, CEOs, and nontechnical hiring managers.

The job title “technical recruiter” can be confusing. While these recruiters hire technical folks, they aren’t always technically trained themselves. This means that when you “talk tech” with recruiters, you should keep it at a basic level. We regularly run a workshop on this exact topic, “Talking Tech with Recruiters.” You can check out our online events on the [Career Engagement Network site](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp).

Look at it this way: When you’re sitting in a room with the hiring manager or your prospective colleagues, you can pull up Jupyter Notebook or send them a link, and they’ll know how to navigate it. But before you can get to that point, you usually have to go through a recruiter or general HR screening just so they can see what you can do.  

The same goes for putting together a presentation for a VP or manager in your company who is not a developer. Tableau allows us to put together these charts in a way that can help us successfully communicate our work and findings with technical recruiters, HR personnel, or other key nontechnical stakeholders in the company.

It’s time for you to boost your profile and make yourself a little bit more marketable by employing some employer-competitive strategies. Consider how you can use the material you’ve learned this week to become more employer-competitive.

**1. Link to your Tableau Public profile**. According to [this article on the Tableau website](https://www.tableau.com/about/blog/2018/7/ways-get-started-tableau-community-90975), “Tableau Public is an open platform where Tableau users globally share their analysis on various topics of interest.” You can use Tableau Public to build a profile to showcase the work you’ve done. Link to your Tableau Public profile from your portfolio and resume. Get started by [creating an account](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/) and setting up your first visualization.

- Whenever you have a recruiting or HR screening call in the future, let them know you have some amazing visualizations for them to check out at your Tableau Public profile. Tell them the link is on your resume, but you can also email it to them directly. (This is the perfect post-interview follow-up opportunity!)

**2. Highlight your Tableau skills.** Add Tableau as a skill in your “Technical Skills” section of your resume. It should be sitting there nice and shiny ready to let prospective employers know that you are already onboarded and ready to go with some of the industry’s most-loved technology platforms.

## Technical Interview

We keep telling you that technical interviewing is a skill that requires constant practice and development—and now you get to practice this skill a little more. Important: Remember, employers are not only looking for the right answer, they’re also observing your process and how you approach a topic or problem. So even if you don’t know the right answer, it’s not the end of the world!  Use the opportunity to demonstrate how you tackle questions for which you don’t immediately know the answer.

Read the following sample interview questions. Before viewing the answer, brainstorm some possible responses and write them down.

- What is data visualization?

  - Clearly, this question will require your response to go beyond Tableau. However, if you know the company uses Tableau, this is a perfect opportunity to explain how Tableau and data visualization go together, as well as why you are the perfect candidate for the job.

  - If you’re stuck on how to answer this question, consult Google and write a succinct definition (2 or 3 sentences) of data visualization. Refer to this definition regularly to remind yourself.

- What are filters? How many filters does Tableau have available?

  - Filters can restrict unnecessary data from your visualization. In other words, they allow us to display only the data that is absolutely necessary to demonstrate our argument or conclusion.

  - Tableau provides a different ways to filter. Be sure to check these out if you’re not familiar with them already.

- What is your daily work process in Tableau?

  - Everyone’s work process is slightly different, but questions like these help the interviewer determine whether you have an established workflow. Are you organized and know what you want to do each day? Do you approach your work methodically? Do you understand “the why” of what you do and why you do it in a particular way? Your answer to this question will also help the company determine if you are a good fit for the team.  

  - Here’s an example of a workflow:

    - Understand the project requirements.
    - Fetch the required data for the project.
    - Create a storyboard.
    - Create visualizations in Tableau.
    - Present the data to your client or the public for review. 

### Case Study

> Global is a leading multinational bank based in Europe. It’s the largest investment bank in the Eurozone and has recently invested in the North American market.
>
> As a result, the company produces a huge amount of data—especially with its recent expansion into the North American market—leading to a need for a robust data analytics and visualization solution. While operating in the Eurozone, Global invested in various business investment tools and self-developed systems that gave company executives everything they needed. However, these tools are no longer able to meet the company’s needs.
>
> After much research, Global has opted to implement Tableau as its core self-service data governance tool across both its European and North American branches. As part of this implementation, they are hiring 50 new data visualization experts and developers to work on Tableau.
>
> You are interviewing for one of these positions. Your Tableau Public profile impressed recruiters and the HR screening. You’ve made it to the second round, when you’ll meet with your prospective manager, also a data visualization expert, who is charged with hiring experts like you to lead the next phase of development.

Consider responses to the following questions, which are focused on helping the hiring manager understand how you work at both the individual and team levels, and how this will affect the company’s goals and strategies. Note that these questions are open-ended—there is no single correct answer.

**Q. How do you think Tableau could help establish stronger customer relationships?**

- Visualizations that display customer satisfaction at different points of the customer journey (e.g., application, user, closing account, dealing with problems, investments, checking and savings account usage) can help the marketing operations team make decisions around website design and UX/UI.

**Q. How else might you create data visualizations that assist our marketing teams?**

- Visualizations can be used to analyze population data in order to help the marketing teams target campaigns for specific populations and determine which platform is the most appropriate (social media, radio, TV, billboards, etc.).

**Q. How could we develop visualizations that help our branch managers improve customer service on the ground?**

- Visualizations can integrate customer data and satisfaction scores with in-branch experiences. Then, the information can be displayed in a way that allows nontechnical branch managers to determine at a glance the areas that need improvement.
