# Requesting a Galaxy Far Far Away

In this activity you will create an application that accesses data from the Star Wars API and prints out values from within it.

## Instructions

  * Using the starter file provided, collect the following pieces of information from the Star Wars API.

    * The name of the character

    * The number of films they were in

    * The name of their first starship

  * Once the data has been collected, print it out to the console.

## Bonus

* Collect and print out all of the films a character appeared in.

## Hint

* It would be in your best interest to print out the JSON from the initial request before anything else. This will let you know what keys you should reference.

* The "starship" values are links to another API call. This means that you will need to create a request based off of the values of a previous request.
