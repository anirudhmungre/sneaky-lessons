# Country World Cup

In this activity, we'll add a circle for each country's all-time Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) World Cup three-point wins.

## Instructions

* Add your code to [logic.js](Unsolved/logic.js) to render the following:

    * A circle for each country in the dataset.
    * A radius size that you determine from the country's all-time three-point wins.
    * A color for each circle that you determine as follows:

      * For countries with more than 200 points, set the color of the circle to yellow.
      * For countries with more than 100 points, set the color of the circle to blue.
      * For countries with more than 90 points, set the color of the circle to green.
      * Render the remaining country circles in red.

* Make sure that each vector layer that you include has a popup with the country's name and number of points.

## Hint

* Universally adjust the radius for better visuals.

* Refer to the [Leaflet documentation for Path options](http://leafletjs.com/reference-1.6.0.html#path-option) if you get stuck creating vector layers.
