# Rock, Paper, Scissors

Create a Rock, Paper, Scissors game that takes user input from the command line and plays against the computer.

## Instructions

* Using the terminal, take an input of `r`, `p`, or `s` for rock, paper, or scissors.

* Have the computer randomly pick one of these three choices.

* Compare the user's input to the computer's choice to determine if the user won, lost, or tied.

## Hint

* Check out this [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/306400/how-to-randomly-select-an-item-from-a-list) question for help with using the `random` module to select a value from a list.
