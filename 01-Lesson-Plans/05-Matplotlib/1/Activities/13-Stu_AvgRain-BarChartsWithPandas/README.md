# Average Rainfall

In this activity, you will create a bar chart that shows the average rainfall in different states by importing data from a CSV file.

## Instructions

* Review the [raw data](Resources/avg_rain_state.csv) in the `Resources` folder. This dataset contains the average rainfall per state in any given year.

* Using the [starter file](Unsolved/avg_state_rain.ipynb), generate a plot that shows the average rainfall per state, as per image below:

![rain_fall](Images/avg_state_rain.png)

## Hint

* Think critically about the different plots we discussed today. Ask yourself which type of plot summarizes the data most effectively.

* Be sure to add a title, axis labels, and any other aesthetic elements that may help make the visualization more effective.
