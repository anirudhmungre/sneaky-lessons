## Lesson Plan - Technical Interview Prep

### Overview

Today's workshop is an opportunity for students to review and practice technical interview questions.

### Instructor Priorities

* Students should work as a team to systematically apply the problem solving guidelines to each problem.

### Instructor Notes

* Today's workshop will include students from various stages in the course. It is important that they all feel included and empowered to contribute their solutions and ideas. Students with little to no programming experience should focus on writing out their solutions as pseudocode.

* Choose a collection of interview questions for the workshop ahead of time. These are available in the [Interview_Questions](../../Interview_Questions) folder.

  * You will need one question for each 15 minute interval.

  * This entails roughly 5-6 interview questions per workshop.

  * Each student has 10-15 minutes to work through a problem. Once the time is up, take a few minutes to call on different groups to explain their solutions.

### Class Objectives

After class, students should be able to:

* Verbalize programming problems before they solve them;

* Explain their approach to solving problems;

* Identify and articulate assumptions they make about problems they work on;

* Discuss shortcomings and improvements they might make to solutions they develop.

### 1. Career Team Do: Welcome Students (0:10)

* Explain that today's workshop will provide students with an opportunity to practice technical interview questions.

### 2. Instructor Do: Technical Interview Questions Introduction (0:05)

* Send out the [Technical Interview Guidelines](../../Resources/Technical_Interview_Guidlines.md), and open them yourself.

* Emphasize that the purpose of these workshops is not primarily to find the correct answer to these questions. Rather, it is to train yourself to take the right _approach_ to problem solving.

  * Explain that, at this stage, following the guidelines matters more than finding the correct solution. Explain that this is because excellent communication is one of the most sought-after traits interviewers screen for.

* Explain that students will be assigned to breakout rooms to work on these problems as a group. Encourage all students to participate and learn from each other. Multiple solutions can be provided.

* Explain the following format for the technical interview session:

  * Interview questions will be sent out through the Zoom chat. Students should copy this question to their own editor.

  * Students will be grouped together through Zoom to discuss the problem and work on one or more answers as a team.

  * After 10-15 minutes, everyone will rejoin the main Zoom session to discuss solutions.

  * The above process will be repeated several times during the session using different problems and groups.

* Ask for any questions before proceeding.

### 3. Students Do: Sorting Lists of Lists (0:15)

* **File**: [Sort_List_of_Lists.ipynb](../../Interview_Questions/01-Sort_List_of_Lists/Unsolved/Sort_List_of_Lists.ipynb)

* Send out an interview question through Zoom chat for students to work on, and start a timer for 15 minutes.

* **Instructions:**

  * Sort the following list of lists by the grades in descending order.

  * The desired output should be

  ```python
  [['Kaylee', 99], ['Simon', 99], ['Zoe', 85], ['Malcolm', 80], ['Wash', 79]]
  ```

* **Bonus:**

  * Try and complete more than one solution for this problem.

* **Hints:**

  * [How to sort with Python](https://wiki.python.org/moin/HowTo/Sorting)

### 4. Everyone Do: Review Activity (0:05)

* At the end of the time limit, gather all students back into the main channel and call on different groups to present their solutions.

  * Ask about any edge cases or sub-optimal solutions and how they might improve their solution to address these

  * Identify what the team did best

  * Ask if there are any areas that they should focus on improving during their next interview.

* Encourage students on a job well done; the important piece is not the answers, but how well students communicated their thought processes.

### 5. Students Do: Text Wrap (0:15)

* **File**: [Text_Wrap.ipynb](../../Interview_Questions/02-Text_Wrap/Unsolved/Text_Wrap.ipynb)

* Send out an interview question through Zoom chat for students to work on, and start a timer for 15 minutes.

* **Instructions:**

  * Write a function that will accept a string and a length N and print every N characters for the string on a separate line.

  * Input:

    ```python
    N = 4
    test_string = "abcdefghijklmn"
    ```

  * Output:

    ```python
    abcd
    efgh
    ijkl
    mn
    ```

### 6. Everyone Do: Review Activity (0:05)

* At the end of the time limit, gather all students back into the main channel and call on different groups to present their solutions.

  * Ask about any edge cases or sub-optimal solutions and how they might improve their solution to address these

  * Identify what the team did best

  * Ask if there are any areas that they should focus on improving during their next interview.

* Encourage students on a job well done; the important piece is not the answers, but how well students communicated their thought processes.

### 7. Students Do: Permutations (0:15)

* **File**: [Permutations.ipynb](../../Interview_Questions/03-Permutations/Unsolved/Permutations.ipynb)

* Send out an interview question through Zoom chat for students to work on, and start a timer for 15 minutes.

* **Instructions:**

  * Given two strings, write a function to check if one string is a permutation of the other

  * Example:

    ```python
    check_permutation("abc", "bca")  # True
    check_permutation("abc", "abcd") # False
    ```

### 8. Everyone Do: Review Activity (0:05)

* At the end of the time limit, gather all students back into the main channel and call on different groups to present their solutions.

  * Ask about any edge cases or sub-optimal solutions and how they might improve their solution to address these

  * Identify what the team did best

  * Ask if there are any areas that they should focus on improving during their next interview.

* Encourage students on a job well done; the important piece is not the answers, but how well students communicated their thought processes.

### 9. Students Do: Duplicate Numbers (0:15)

* **File**: [Duplicate_Numbers.ipynb](../../Interview_Questions/04-Duplicate_Numbers/Unsolved/Duplicate_Numbers.ipynb)

* Send out an interview question through Zoom chat for students to work on, and start a timer for 15 minutes.

* **Instructions:**

  * Challenge 1: Print all numbers with duplicates

  * Challenge 2: Print only the numbers that were seen once

  * Challenge 3: Count the number of duplicates

### 10. Everyone Do: Review Activity (0:05)

* Send out an interview question through Zoom chat for students to work on, and start a timer for 15 minutes.

* **Instructions:**

  * Combine two lists such that the result is a single list with no duplicate values

### 12. Everyone Do: Review Activity (0:05)
