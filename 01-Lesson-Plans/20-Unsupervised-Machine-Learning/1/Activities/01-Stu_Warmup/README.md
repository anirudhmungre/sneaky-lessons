# KNN

In this activity, you will use KNN model to predict weather a tumor is malignant or benign.


## Instructions:

* In this activity, you will use a KNN model to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign.

* Use `breast_cancer.csv` as your dataset.

  * The dataset has 30 columns. The last, `target`, states whether a tumor sample is bening or malignant.

* Split the dataset into data and target (X and y).

  * Further split the dataset into training and testing sets.

* Standardize the data with the `StandardScaler` module.

  * Create standardized sets for X training data and x test data.

* Instantiate a KNN model with k (`n_neighbors`) set to 9.

* Train the model and create predictions with the X test set.

* Use the `accuracy_score` module to assess the accuracy of the KNN model.
