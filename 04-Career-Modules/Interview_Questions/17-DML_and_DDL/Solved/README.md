# DML & DDL

## Part 1

* What is the difference between `DML` and `DDL` in SQL?

## Part 2

* Demonstrate a use of `DDL` in the following table:

  * vendor_table
    ![vendor_table](../Images/vendor_table.png)

## Solutions

* Part 1: `DML` refers to `Data Manipulation Language`. There are several DML statements used to update, insert, or delete data in a table. `DDL` stands for `Data Definition Language`, which deals with the structure of the data.

  * Examples of `DDL` include `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`, `TRUNCATE`, `COMMENT`, and `RENAME`.

  * `DML` commands include `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.

* Part 2: several different `DDL` commands are available for use on the table.

  * `DROP` to drop the table completely.

  * `ALTER` will add one or more columns, modify an existing column, drop a column, rename a column, or rename a table.

  * `CREATE` creates a new table.

  * `DROP` will drop or remove an existing table from a database.

  * `TRUNCATE` will remove all records from an existing table within a database.

  * `COMMENT` is used to add a comment to a data dictionary.

  * `RENAME` can be used to rename existing tables and columns in a database.
