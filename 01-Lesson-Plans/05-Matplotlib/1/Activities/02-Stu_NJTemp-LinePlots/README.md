# New Jersey Weather

In this activity, you will visualize the differences between temperature recorded in degrees Fahrenheit versus degrees Celsius.

## Instructions

* Using the following data, plot the monthly averages for temperature in New Jersey in both degrees Fahrenheit and degrees Celsius.

  * Average temperature per month in Fahrenheit: 39, 42, 51, 62, 72, 82, 86, 84, 77, 65, 55, 44.

* Assign to the x-axis a range of numerical values representing each month of the year.

* Plot the degrees Fahrenheit points.

* Use a list comprehension to convert the temperature to degrees Celsius.

  * The formula for conversion is: C = (F – 32) * 0.56. In this formula, C is degrees Celsius and F is degrees Fahrenheit.

* Plot the degrees Celsius points.

* Create a third plot with both the degrees Fahrenheit and degrees Celsius points.
