# Career Connection

Welcome back to another Career Connection. This week you built upon your introduction to Python by learning another popular Python library for data science—Matplotlib. With even more Python under your belt, you’re well on your way to becoming a Python developer and data visualization guru that can help businesses visualize their data and improve their processes!

So what’s the deal with Matplotlib?

[With over 11,000 stars, 898 contributors, and over 34,000 commits](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib), Matplotlib is an extremely popular and powerful tool, and wherever you end up after boot camp, there’s a good chance you’ll encounter Matplotlib in the workplace—whether directly or indirectly—for creating visualizations in Python.

It’s very common for data analysis teams to create graphs to “explore the data,” which is part of what we call the **EDA process**, or exploratory data analysis.

This term has been mentioned briefly in this module, and you’ve actually already learned parts of this process throughout the weeks—now we’re just giving it a name. If a prospective employer were to ask you what EDA is during an interview, you might say something like:

> Exploratory Data Analysis is the process of performing initial investigations on data through which we explore patterns, discover anomalies, test hypotheses, and create graphical representations of the data.

Essentially, EDA is an iterative process that requires some initial data wrangling to clean, sort,  and create features to generate new hypotheses and visualizations. The visualizations are most often made up using Matplotlib. After the initial visualization, there can be more data cleaning and transformation with visualizations to help gain a further understanding of the data.

**Time to update that resume!**

As per usual, go ahead and update your resume with your new skill set. If you haven’t already done so, add Matplotlib to your resume in the “Technical Skills” section.

## Technical Interview

We have no interview preparation questions for you this week. The best thing you can do to prepare for a technical interview that engages with Matplotlib is to spend as much time using the technology as possible.

See if you can find some datasets that you can use to create some Matplotlib visualizations.

Here are some free options you might use:

1. [United States Census Data](https://www.census.gov/data.html)
2. [FBI Crime Data](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2016/crime-in-the-u.s.-2016/topic-pages/tables/table-1)
3. [CDC Cause of Death](https://www.cdc.gov/datastatistics/index.html)
4. [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/data/)
5. [Walmart Sales Data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting/data)
