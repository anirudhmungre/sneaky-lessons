# GitHub Pages Project Webpage

In this activity, you will be creating a web page to display and explain a data science project you already completed and wil deploy the HTML to a github pages project page.

## Instructions

* Now that you know how to create webpages for specific projects, navigate into the repository of one of your previous activities or homework assignments and create a basic webpage for that project.

* Make a simple website that explains what the purpose of the activity was and shows off some of the work that you have done.

  * Create a header that will act as a title for the page.
  * Create a few short paragraphs describing the project's purpose.
  * Try to include at least one table or a picture of a graph that shows off some of the data you collected.
  * Have some fun! Test your HTML skills by going above and beyond with your page!

* Once you have created your HTML, add, commit, and push your files up to GitHub Pages.

  * Make sure to navigate to your page in the web browser to ensure your website is live.

* Deployment Guide:

  * Create a new repository on your GitHub account. You can name this repository whatever you would like.
  * Once inside of the repository, create a new file and name it index.html
  * Add your HTML into this file, save it, and then navigate into your repository's Settings tab.
  * Scroll down to the GitHub Pages section and then, in the section labeled Source, select that you would like to use the main branch as your source.
  * Navigate to `_username_.github.io/_repositoryname_` and you will find that your new web page has gone live!

## Bonus

* Try to create a navigation system which links from your personal website to this new project site and vice-versa.

* See if you can create something of a portfolio that can be used to show off all of the work you have done in the past.
