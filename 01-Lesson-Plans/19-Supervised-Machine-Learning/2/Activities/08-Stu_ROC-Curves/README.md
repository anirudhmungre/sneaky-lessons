# ROC Curves

In this activity, you'll create a KNN model to predict heart disease from the UCI Heart Disease dataset. You'll then create an ROC curve for the model.

## Instructions

* Load the UCI Heart Disease dataset, and then split the data into training and testing sets.

* Find an optimal value of k for a KNN model.

* Print the confusion matrix and the classification report for your model.

* Create a plot of the ROC curve for your model.
