# Grid Search and Hyperparameter Tuning

In this activity, you'll use `GridSearchCV()` and `RandomizedSearchCV()` to choose the parameters for a logistic regression model on the Pima Diabetes dataset.

## Instructions

1. Use the provided starter code, and apply `GridSearchCV()` and `RandomizedSearchCV()` to a logistic regression model. Change the `C` and `tol` parameters.

2. Note that you can use any values that you want to try, but the notebook comments include suggested values.

3. Print the best parameters and the best score for both tuned models.

4. Calculate the predictions by using one of the tuned models and the `X_test` data, and then print the classification report.
