# Psychiatric Health Care

In this activity, you will work with 2014 data on in-patient psychiatric patient care in hospitals across the United States.

## Instructions

* The data set contains information on, among other things:

  * The number of patients who were discharged with a continuing care plan.
  * The number of patients who were discharged with multiple anti-psychotic medications.
  * The use of physical restraint.
  * The use of seclusion.

* You will first have to clean the data, which at a minimum will require fixing the column headings. Once they have cleaned the data, the next goal is to start interpret the data and what it could be telling us. They will use the included **HBIPS_Measure_Sets.pdf** to accomplish this task.

  * For example, `HBIPS3` in the CSV refers to the use of seclusion, in hours.

  * Students should first create the necessary tableau worksheets; once completed, they can generate a dashboard similar to the one below.

* Afterwards, create additional visualizations of your choosing. Focus on data exploration, rather than obtaining pre-defined visualizations. You are encouraged to come up with interesting and creative visualizations, and you are free to bring additional data sources into the workbook.
