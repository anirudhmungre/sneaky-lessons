# Search For The Worst

In this activity, you will take a dataset on San Francisco Airport's utility consumption and determine which day in the dataset had the worst consumption for each utility.

## Instructions

* Read in the CSV file provided, and print it to the screen.

* Print out a list of all the values within the "Utility" column.

* Select a value from this list, and create a new DataFrame that only includes that utility. Note that some utilities have more than one option for "Owner," and you may want to limit this new DataFrame to a single "Owner."

* Sort the DataFrame based on the level of consumption, from most to least.

* Reset the index for the DataFrame so that the index is in order.

* Print out the details of the worst day to the screen.
