### Career Services

Each week, students will review a Career Connection document in the [04-Career-Modules folder](../../04-Career-Modules/). This document relates each week's material to a professional setting, encourages students to complete certain career-related tasks, and provides examples of technical interview questions, where applicable.

If you haven't already done so, remember to push this entire folder to the student repository so that the students can access it.

Remind the students that related career material can be found in this supplemental folder.

If you'd like more information about career services, visit our [Career Engagement Network page](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp%29).
