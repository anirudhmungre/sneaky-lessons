# Aimed Positioning of HTML Elements

In this activity, you will be given an HTML file you will style using CSS. In particular, they will be posting certain elements as described in the instructions. 

## Instructions

* Open the [Unsolved Starter](Unsolved/AimedPositioning.html).

* Using CSS, position the five headers in the starter code in their described locations.

  * Try to accomplish this using the box model.
  * Try to accomplish this using absolute positioning.

* Whenever you complete a step, save a unique version of your stylesheet and then create a new stylesheet for the next step.

## Bonus

* Try to move the HTML elements provided using different kinds of positioning (static, relative, and fixed).

## Hint

* You can move elements around the page using pixels OR percentages. Try out both to see how they work.

* Not every task is capable of being accomplished without changing the order of HTML elements. Even then, some positions may still be impossible.
