# Other Markers

In this activity, we'll create three vector shapes to use as markers.

## Instructions

Using the files in the `Unsolved` folder as a starting point, create the following vector layers, and then add them to the map:

* A red circle over the city of Dallas

* A line connecting NYC to Toronto

* A polygon that covers the area inside Atlanta, Savannah, Jacksonville, and Montgomery

## Hint

* Note that the [logic.js](Unsolved/logic.js) file contains some starter code.

* Use the Vector Layers section of the [Leaflet documentation](http://leafletjs.com/reference-1.6.0.html#toc) for reference.
