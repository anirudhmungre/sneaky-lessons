# Choose Your Story

In this activity, you will practice using conditionals by creating the first step of a role-playing adventure.

## Instructions

Create an Excel workbook and VBA macro that provides a user with an input field and a single button. Based on the user-input number (1, 2, 3, or 4), the button will trigger different message boxes as follows: 

* If the user enters a value of 1, display “You choose to enter the wooded forest of doom!”

* If the user enters a value of 2, display “You choose to enter the fiery volcano of doom!”

* If the user enters a value of 3, display “You choose to enter the terrifying jungle of doom!”

*  If the user enters a value of 4, display a similar custom message.

* If the user enters anything else, display “You decide to stay home instead.”
