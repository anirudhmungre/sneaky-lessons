# Confusion Matrix Interpretation

In this activity, you'll create a logistic regression model to predict diabetes for the Pima Diabetes dataset. You'll then interpret the confusion matrix that the model produces.

## Instructions

* Load the Pima Diabetes dataset, and then split the data into training and testing sets.

* Fit a logistic regression model to the training set.

* Create a confusion matrix of the predicted vs. the actual outcomes for the testing set.

* Manually calculate the precision, sensitivity, and F1 score of the model by using the values from the confusion matrix.

* Create the classification report, and compare it to your manually calculated scores.

* Answer the following questions: Is your model more precise or more sensitive? Which is more important for this model?
