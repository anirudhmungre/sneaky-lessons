# City Markers

In this activity, you'll create a map and plot markers for five United States cities.

## Instructions

* Find the latitude and longitude for the following US cities:

    * New York
    * Los Angeles
    * Houston
    * Omaha
    * Chicago

* Create a marker for each city with a popup that displays the city's name and population. For this activity, you can either look up the population for each city or make one up.

## Bonus

* A popup takes a string of HTML. If you finish early, try experimenting with passing different tags or custom CSS.

## Hint

* Don't forget to add the marker to your map after creating it.
