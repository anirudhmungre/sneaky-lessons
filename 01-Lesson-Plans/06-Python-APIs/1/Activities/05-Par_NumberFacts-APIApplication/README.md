# Number Facts API

* **Instructions:**

  * Using the [Numbers API](http://numbersapi.com), create an application that takes in a user's inputs and returns a number fact based upon it.

* **Hints:**

  * The URL to make your request to must have `?json` at its end so that the data format returned is JSON. The default response is pure text.

  * Make sure to read through the documentation when creating your application. Some types require more or less data than others.
