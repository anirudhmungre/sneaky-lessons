# Adding Flair to DullCorp

In this activity, you will be updating the DULL Corporation’s website so that it is not nearly so...Dull. To do so, you will be creating an external stylesheet and linking it to pre-made HTML.

## Instructions

* Open the [Unsolved Starter](Unsolved/DullCorp.html).

* Using external CSS and your imagination, update the "DULL Corp" website to be more interesting.

  * Center the `header` element to the page.
  * Set each `h1`,`h2`, and `h3` element to be a different color.
  * Set `img` element to have a shadow.
  * Give the `section` element a background color.
  * Change the font size of both `paragraph` elements.
  * Place a border around the `ul` element.
