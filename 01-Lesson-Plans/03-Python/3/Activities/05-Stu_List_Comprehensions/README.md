# List Comprehensions

In this activity, you’ll use list comprehensions to compose a wedding invitation, which you will send to every name on your mailing list.

## Instructions

* Open the file called `comprehensions.py`.

* Run the provided program. Note that nothing forces you to write the name properly in title case&mdash;for example, as "Jane" instead of "jAnE". You will use list comprehensions to fix this.

  * First, use list comprehensions to create a new list that contains the lowercase version of each of the names your user provided.

  * Then, use list comprehensions to create a new list that contains the title-case versions of each of the names in your lowercase list.

## Hint

* Check out the documentation for the [title method](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.title).
