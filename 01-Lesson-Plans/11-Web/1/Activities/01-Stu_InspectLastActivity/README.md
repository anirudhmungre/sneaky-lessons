# Inspect Hello, HTML

In this activity, you and your partner will spend a few minutes going over the example coded out in the last example and use Chrome Devtools to inpect it. 

## Instructions

Open the example from the last activity slacked out to you in Chrome and open Chrome Devtools. You can launch Chrome Devtools by doing any of the following:

* Right click the rendered HTML document inside of Chrome and clicking the `inspect` option.

* Pressing `F12` on Windows while in Chrome.

* Pressing `command + option + i` on a Mac.

* Make sure the `Elements` tab is selected.

* Study the code here and see how it compares to the actual HTML document slacked out.

* Experiment with modifying the HTML document in VS Code and reloading the web page and inspector. 

* What happens when you remove an element's closing tag or misspell `head` or `html`?
