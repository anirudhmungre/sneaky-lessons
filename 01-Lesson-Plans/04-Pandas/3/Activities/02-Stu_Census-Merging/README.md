# Census Merging

In this activity, you will merge the two Census datasets that we created in the last class and then do a calculation and sort the values. 

## Instructions

* Read in both of the CSV files, and print out their DataFrames.

* Perform an inner merge that combines both DataFrames on the "Year" and "State" columns.

* Create a DataFrame that filters the data on only 2019.

* Add a new column that calculates the Poverty Rate.

* Sort the data by Poverty Rate and Average Per Capita Income by County, highest to lowest, to find the state or territory with the highest poverty rate.

* Print out the data for the state or territory with the highest poverty rate.

* Bonus: Print out the data for the state or territory with the lowest poverty rate with one line of code.
