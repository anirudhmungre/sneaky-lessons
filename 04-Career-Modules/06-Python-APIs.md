# Career Connection

Welcome, welcome! Whoa—that was an intense week of material, right? But this is where things get really exciting because you can use all sorts of services to collect data and use it in your own analysis or applications.

It’s possible that you'll use third-party APIs very often. Companies use these technologies in several ways, but the following two situations are among the most common use cases:

## Collecting information from third-party services

Companies like Lyft, DoorDash, and Airbnb don't create their own proprietary mapping systems. Instead, they use the Google Maps Platform, much like you did this week when you made requests to third-party servers. Companies commonly use data and toolsets offered by others—so everything you learned this week will be incredibly useful moving forward! Doing so means they can extract large datasets and try to establish trends that make their competitors successful in certain areas.

## Collecting information from another server in their own organization

Let's say you're working at an insurance company which is building an application to track which premiums have been paid and which haven't. Your company has developed a standalone app that handles the customer payment portal. When your own application needs to know whether a premium has been paid or not, it makes an API call to the payment app, which sends its response back to you. You might use non-payment information from a large number of customers to establish non-payment trends for the business.

## Look to the Future

You might remember from the first Career Connection lesson that most of our students who achieve employer-competitive status find development jobs within six months after they complete the boot camp. How can you use the material you’ve learned this week to become more employer-competitive?

### Task #1: On LinkedIn, Connect with Five People at Companies You're Interested in

If you’ve never used LinkedIn before, don’t be shy! We can help you become familiar with it. Sign up for a new account or, if you already have an account, log in at LinkedIn.com. Take time to browse—you can send and receive messages, post statuses, and make connections, just like on other social media platforms. Just remember, LinkedIn is a professional networking platform, so reserve those cute kitty GIFs for your Instagram.

Once you’ve acquainted yourself with the platform, search for local companies that you'd like to work for. You can see who else follows these companies and even who works there. Find someone who might have insight into the company with a title like Technical Recruiter, HR Manager, or Senior Developer. Request to connect with them and write a personal message introducing yourself.

Here's an example:

- Good afternoon, **employee name**. My name is **your name**. I’m reaching out because I live in the area and I’m a new **data …** looking to network with professionals in the field, like you. I'm particularly interested in working for **company name** because **add reasons why you'd like to work here**, and I was wondering if you could tell me what you love about working there. Thanks for connecting with me!

Do with this with five or six employees at different companies that interest you.

### Task #2: Follow Desired Companies on Social Media

In addition to LinkedIn, companies with a customer-facing or public presence might also use Facebook, Instagram, and other social media sites. Start following companies that interest you on these platforms. For example, if cloud computing interests you, you might follow Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Digital Ocean.

Taking this step will build up your feed with technical content, allowing you to engage in more conversations in the industry you’re joining!

## Technical Interview

Here are 3 important API questions that you should know the answer to. See if you can figure out the right answer, and jot it down in a notebook or in a text editor. Once you’re done, take a look at the solution.

- Explain what REST is?
  - REST stands for Representational State Transfer.
- What are some common HTTP methods supported by REST and when do you use them?
  - GET—requesting a resource. POST—submitting new information. 
  - PUT—updates an entire resource. PATCH—updates a partial resource. 
  - DELETE—removes a resource.
- What is the most popular to represent data transfer in a restful API?
  - JSON and XML
