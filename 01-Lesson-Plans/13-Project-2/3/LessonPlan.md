* Your project week may have been shifted due to a holiday. This means that students will have less time to work on projects today.

  * It may be helpful to remind students that there are office hours before and after class that may be used for extended project work.

  * Alternatively they may coordinate with team members to work on their projects outside of class.

* Students will use today's class to wrap up their ETL projects.

* Today's class will end with a discussion of the projects.

* Remember that this project, like the other projects in this course, is to be graded by yourself and your fellow instructional team members.

* The rubric for this project can be found here: [Project 2 Rubric - Extract, Transform, and Load](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-sJWb5pq3OeFBPAZ_IDXR9LJvY7PoCUickgjTsPVnWo/edit?usp=sharing).
