# Grid Search and Hyperparameter Tuning

In this activity, you'll use `GridSearchCV()` and `RandomizedSearchCV()` to choose the parameters for a KNN model on the Pima Diabetes dataset.

## Instructions

1. Use the provided starter code, and apply `GridSearchCV()` and `RandomizedSearchCV()` to a `KNeighborsClassifier` model. Change the `n_neighbors`, `weights`, and `leaf_size` parameters.

2. You can use any values that you want to try, but the notebook comments include suggested values.

3. Print the best parameters and the best score for both tuned models.

4. Calculate predictions by using one of the tuned models and the `X_test` data, and then print the classification report.
