# Crypto Kennel

The spreadsheet you'll be working with in this activity is full of animal inspired cryptocurrency! In place of numerical data, when you open your file you'll be greeted by cells filled with the words "Shiba Inu", "Dogecoin", or "Cat Token", however your crypto kennel is for canines only! Instead of manually removing the unwanted feline crypto, you'll use VBA to do the work for you.

## Instructions

* Create a VBA script to handle the over-abundance of the `Cat Token` currency in your spreadhseet's "crypto kennel".

* There are three parts to this problem:

  * **Part 1:** Count the number of times `Cat Token` appears and display the number to your user in the form of a message box.

  * **Part 2:** Modify the script such that it changes the word `Cat Token` to `Dogecoin`.

  * **Part 3:** Modify the script a third time, this time keeping in mind that you have a limited number of `Shiba Inu` and `Dogecoin`. Use the full set of `Shiba Inu` and `Dogecoin` you have available to replace all instances of `Cat Token`. If you run out of `Shiba Inu` or `Dogecoin` provide the user with the message: "Oh no! We still have some Cat Token..."

## Hints

* You may want to create a backup of your spreadsheet as your macro will write over the contents.

* Take lots of deep breaths!
