# SEM and Error Bars

In this activity, you will work with a partner to characterize sample data from a California housing dataset. Make sure to compare your calculated values as you progress through the activity.

## Instructions

Work with a partner on this activity. Be sure to compare your calculated values as you progress through the activity.

* Open the [samples.ipynb](Unsolved/samples.ipynb) in the activity folder.

    * Execute the starter code to import the California housing dataset from Scikit-learn.

    * Create a sample set of median housing prices using Pandas. Set the sample size to 20.

    * Calculate the means and standard errors for each sample.

    * Create a plot displaying the means for each sample, with the standard error as error bars.

    * Calculate the range of SEM values across the sample set.

    * Determine which sample's mean is closest to the population mean.

    * Compare this sample's mean to the population's mean.

    * Rerun your sampling code a few times to generate new sample sets. Try changing the sample size and then rerunning the sampling code.

* Discuss with your partner what changes you observe when sample size changes.
