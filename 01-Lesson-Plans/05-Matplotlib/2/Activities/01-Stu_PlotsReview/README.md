# PyPlot Warmup

In this activity, you will use PyPlot to create the most effective visualization for a variety of datasets.

## Instructions

* Open the unsolved [activity file](Unsolved/plot_drills.ipynb), and examine the starter code for each dataset.

* Determine what chart or plot fits with the starter code for each dataset.

* Complete the code block to create a plot for each of the datasets. 

* Be sure to provide each plot with a title and labels.

## Hint

If you are unsure about what type of data is contained in the starter code, print it out!
