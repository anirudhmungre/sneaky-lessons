# Finding the Features from the Trees

In this activity, you'll use a Random Forests model to find the most important features for predicting arrhythmia in heartbeats.

## Instructions

* Import the arrhythmia data, and then fit a Random Forests model to the scaled and split data.

* Import SelectModel to extract the best features from the Random Forests model.

* Fit a logistic regression to the original dataset, and then print its score.

* Fit a logistic regression to the selected dataset, and then print its score.

* Compare the scores of the two logistic regression models.
