# Degrees That Pay

You will now build upon everything they have learned today in order to create a story in Tableau that visualizes what degrees/universities/regions pay out the best over time.

## Instructions

* Create a story using the datasets provided and formulate graphs that might be used to explore the following hypotheses:

* "Ivy League schools offer best salaries while state offer worst"

* "Going to school in W/NE offers higher salaries"

* "Higher starting salaries generally mean higher salaries mid-career"

    **Note:** You do not have to join any of the data for this activity. The worksheets that you will be creating do not require you to join the datasets in Tableau.

## Bonus

* Create a chart that visualizes starting median salaries, by major, against mid-career median, 75th percentile, and 90th percentile salaries.
