# DBSCAN with Iris

In this activity, you will attempt to identify clusters in the iris dataset using DBSCAN.

## Instructions

* In this activity, you will attempt to identify clusters in the iris dataset using DBSCAN.

* Scale the dataset, then perform DBSCAN for cluster analysis. You will have to adjust your `eps` and `min_samples` parameters.

* Use DBSCAN to generate target labels for the dataset.

* Try creating a scatter plot of the dataset, coloring by cluster. The dataset has four features, but you will only be able to use two of them.

* Be ready to discuss the following:

  * How many clusters did DBSCAN identify?

  * Did you end up with the expected number of clusters? Explain your results.
