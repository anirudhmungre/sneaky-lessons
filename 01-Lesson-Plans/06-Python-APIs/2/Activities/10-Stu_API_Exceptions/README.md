# API Exceptions

Not every call placed to an API will return a result. In this activity, you will use try/except to handle errors from API calls.

## Instructions

* Loop through the characters in the list and send a request to the Star Wars API.

* Create a try clause and an except clause. In the try clause, append the height, mass and character that is available in the Star Wars API. If the character is not available in the Star Wars API, use the except clause to print a message and `pass`.

* Create a DataFrame from the results.

* Drop any rows with null values to remove characters not in the Star Wars universe.
