# 3.1: Introduction to Python

## Overview

In today's class, students will transition from VBA to the Python programming language. To start, we‚Äôll check the Python installation for students; then, we‚Äôll cover the basics of terminal navigation, variables, conditionals, and loops.

## Class Objectives

By the end of this lesson, the students will be able to:

* Perform their Python 3 installation.

* Navigate through files and folders via the terminal.

* Create Python scripts and run them in the terminal.

* Understand basic programming concepts in Python.

## Instructor Prep

<details>
  <summary><strong>Instructor Notes</strong></summary>

* Students should all have a working `conda` environment for this class. Take a moment to ensure that everyone is comfortable with `conda`, which should be used for all activities today. Students may need a reminder to activate this environment. Windows users will also need to launch their environment with `git-bash`&mdash;not their Windows command prompt or PowerShell.

* We have a lot to cover, and students may find themselves frustrated by some of the quirks that Git Bash, Anaconda, Terminal, or Python have in store. It‚Äôs important that you maintain a positive tone and are prepared to help the class fix whatever bugs they encounter.

* Try to identify confused students who may be reluctant to raise their hands and ask for assistance. Have the TAs circulate during the sections of the lesson that deal with console commands, especially as very few students will have ever worked with a computer this way. Also, regularly encourage the class to ask questions whenever they are confused, and reassure them that confusion is simply part of the learning process.

* Please reference our [Student FAQ](../../../05-Instructor-Resources/README.md#unit-03-python) for answers to questions frequently asked by students of this program. If you have any recommendations for additional questions, feel free to log an issue or a pull request with your desired additions.

* Have your TAs refer to the [Time Tracker](TimeTracker.xlsx) to stay on track.

* Open the [slideshow](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dd31Qpb8ksD2tUfeQT4b9qr44Vz-EB8ZbPl5ACwQoRQ/edit?usp=sharing), and use the first few slides to facilitate your welcome to the class. Cover the following points:

  * Welcome students, and explain that we will now proceed to a more traditional programming language, Python, which we‚Äôll be working with for the next several weeks.

  * Explain to students that the most significant change from Visual Basic will be the syntax; the fundamental concepts are the same.

* Slack out the following files for students to use as reference guides as they progress through Python.

  * [Student Guide](../StudentGuide.md)

  * [Python CheatSheet](../Supplemental/Python_Reference_Guide.pdf)

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>üì£ 1.2 Instructor Do: Terminal (0:10)</strong></summary>

* Continue using the slideshow to accompany this demonstration.

* Explain that all Python code will be executed through either Git Bash or the Mac Terminal. Windows users should always use Git Bash, and Mac users should use the Terminal.

* Send out [CommonCommands.txt](Activities/01-Ins_Terminal/Solved/CommonCommands.txt) for the students to use as a reference.

* Open up the terminal or Git Bash, and guide students through the following commands:

  * `cd` changes the directory.

  * `cd ~` changes to the home directory.

  * `cd ..` moves up one directory.

  * `ls` lists files in the folder.

  * `pwd` shows the current directory.

  * `mkdir <FOLDERNAME>` creates a new directory with the FOLDERNAME.

  * `touch <FILENAME>` creates a new file with the FILENAME.

  * `rm <FILENAME>` deletes a file.

  * `rm -r <FOLDERNAME>` deletes a folder; note the ‚Äú-r‚Äù to students.

  * `open .` opens the current folder on Macs.

  * `explorer .` opens the current folder on Windows.

  * `open <FILENAME>` opens a specific file on Macs.

  * `explorer <FILENAME>` opens a specific file on Windows.

  * The following image captures a demonstration of the listed commands.
  ![Terminal Example](Images/TerminalExample.png).

* Take a moment to answer any questions before proceeding.

* Now that you have demonstrated basic terminal navigation, guide students through editing Python files and running them in the terminal.

  * Create and navigate into a `PythonStuff` folder on the desktop.

  * Create and open `first_file.py` using the text editor.

  * Add `print("This is my first Python file")`, and save the code.

  * Return to the terminal, and run the file using `python first_file.py`.

  * Explain that `python <FILENAME>.py` tells the computer that this is a Python file and to run the code.

  * The following image captures these commands in the terminal:

  ![Terminal Example](Images/02-Terminal_Example.png)

  * Repeat the process with `second_file.py`, using the code `print("This is my second python file")`.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>‚úèÔ∏è 1.3 Students Do: Terminal (0:10)</strong></summary>

* Now, students will do some work in the terminal. They‚Äôll create three folders and a pair of Python files to print strings of their own creation to the console.

* After answering any questions that students have about the activity, send out the instructions.

* Open the slideshow, and use the next slides as an accompaniment to the activity.

* **Instructions**

* Use the following instructions and commands in your terminal:

  * Create a folder called `LearnPython`.

  * Navigate into the folder.

  * Inside `LearnPython`, create another folder called `Assignment1`.

  * Inside `Assignment1`, create a file called `quick_python.py`.

  * Add a print statement to `quick_python.py`.

  * Run `quick_python.py`.

  * Return to the `LearnPython` folder.

  * Inside `LearnPython`, create another folder called `Assignment2`.

  * Inside `Assignment2`, create a file called `quick_python2.py`.

  * Add a different print statement to `quick_python2.py`.

  * Run `quick_python2.py`.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>‚≠ê 1.4 Review: Terminal (0:05)</strong></summary>

* Open and send out [TerminalGamesSolved.sh](Activities/02-Stu_TerminalTest/Solved/TerminalGamesSolved.sh), then work through the solution code in the terminal while displaying the results on the computer.

* Cover the following key points during your review of this activity:

  * `mkdir` will make the directories.

  * `cd` changes into directories.

  * `touch` will create the file. It will be empty.

  * To add lines of code to these files, simply edit them in a text editor.

  * Then, we can run the code using `python quick_python.py`. Remind students using Macs to run the `which python` command, which will allow them to check that they are using Anaconda's Python (3.7+) instead of the default Mac version (2.7).

  * `cd ..` will take you back **one** level to the `LearnPython` folder, where the process can be repeated.

  * `cd ../..` will take you back **two** levels.

  * Demonstrate and discuss the benefit of using the tab key for autocompletion while typing the path to a directory or running a file.

  * Demonstrate and discuss the benefits of using the _up_ and _down_ arrow keys instead of repeatedly typing commands or using the tab key.

  * Finally, guide students through the process of retrieving their command history by typing `history` on the command line.

## 2. Anaconda Check & Virtual Environment

| Activity Time:       0:15 |  Elapsed Time:      0:45  |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|

<details>
  <summary><strong>üéâ 2.1 Everyone Do: Check Your Anaconda Installation (0:05)</strong></summary>

* Open the slideshow, and use the next slides for this activity.

* Quickly check that students have `conda` installed and added to their path.

* Open up the console, and have students follow along.

  * Enter `conda --version`, which will display the version of Anaconda installed, as in the following image:

    ![Anaconda Version](Images/conda_version.png)

* Have TAs help any students who are experiencing difficulty. The most common problem will likely be that some students with Windows don't have the Anaconda PATH variable set.

  * This can be fixed manually by adding the PATH to Windows' environment variables. An easier solution is to uninstall/reinstall Anaconda and make sure to check the "Install to Path" box that comes up in a menu.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>üéâ 2.2 Everyone Do: Create a Virtual Environment (0:10)</strong></summary>

* Continue stepping through the slideshow as an accompaniment to this activity.

* Next, proceed to an explanation of [virtual environments](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html).

  * Virtual environments create an isolated environment for Python projects.

  * Explain how different projects can have different dependencies.

  * Explain how different projects might also use different types and versions of libraries.

  * This virtual environment will make sure that everyone has all the right dependencies for future class activities.

* Create a virtual environment that will run Python 3.7. This will help solve issues where students have multiple versions of Python installed.

  * First, send out the [Mac OSX requirements file](../../../06-Curriculum-Resources/Python_Environments/intro_python_requirements_osx.txt) and [Windows requirements files](../../../06-Curriculum-Resources/Python_Environments/intro_python_requirements_windows.txt) to students. These files will tell Anaconda which Python libraries to install in our virtual environment.

  * First, run `conda create -n PythonData --file <path to requirements file> python=3.7` in the terminal.

    * Ensure that students use the appropriate requirements file for their operating system.
    
    * Also ensure that students update the path variable to the file path for their local machine.

    * Warn students that this install may take a few minutes.

  * Next, enter `source activate PythonData` to activate the environment. When `(PythonData)$` appears, you are in the environment.

  * Now, make sure that everyone is using the correct version of Python by entering `python --version`, as in the following image:

    ![Python version](Images/python_version.png)

  * Finally, explain that you can exit the environment by entering `source deactivate`. If `source deactivate` does not work, try using `conda deactivate` instead.

* Remind students that they will need to activate their environment each time they open a new terminal. Windows users should always use `git-bash` for their terminal.

## 3. Hello, Variable World!

| Activity Time:       0:20 |  Elapsed Time:      1:05  |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|

<details>
  <summary><strong>üì£ 3.1 Instructor Do: Variables (0:05)</strong></summary>

* Continue through the slideshow, using the next few slides to faciliate a discussion about variables.

* Open and share [variables.py](Activities/03-Ins_Variables/Solved/variables.py), and explain to students that variables let us store information that we can use later.

  * Remind students how VBA accessed certain values when they referred to a specific cell. This is essentially what a variable does in Python&mdash;it stores a value.

* Guide students through the code, and explain the following points:

  * Variables can store different data types, like strings, integers, and an entirely new data type called Booleans, which hold `True` or `False` values.

    ```python
    # Creates a variable with a string "Frankfurter"
    title = "Frankfurter"

    # Creates a variable with an integer 80
    years = 80

    # Creates a variable with the boolean value of True
    expert_status = True
    ```

  * We can print statements that include variables, but traditional Python formatting won't concatenate strings with other data types. This means integers and Booleans must be cast as strings using the `str()` function.

    ```python
    # Prints a statement adding the variable
    print("Nick is a professional " + title)

    # Convert the integer years into a string and prints
    print("He has been coding for " + str(years) + " years")

    # Converts a boolean into a string and prints
    print("Expert status: " + str(expert_status))
    ```

  * Alternatively, the **f-string** method of string interpolation allows strings to be formatted with different data types. Demonstrate the differences by refactoring the last print statement as an f-string:

    ```python
    # An f-string accepts all data types without conversion
    print(f"Expert status: {expert_status}")
    ```

* Send out the following reference guide for [Python 3's f-Strings](https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/).

* Answer any questions that students may have before moving on to the next activity.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>‚úèÔ∏è 3.2 Students Do: Hello, Variable World! (0:10)</strong></summary>

* Continue through the slideshow, using the next slides as an accompaniment to this activity.

* Now it‚Äôs time to create a simple Python application that uses variables. The application will run calculations on integers and print strings out to the console.

* Open up [04-Stu_HelloVariableWorld](Activities/04-Stu_HelloVariableWorld/Solved/HelloVariableWorld.py) within the terminal, and run and discuss the code to give students an idea of how the application should function, as captured in the following image:

  ![Hello Variable World](Images/04-HelloVariableWorld_Output.png)

* Then, send out the following instructions:

* **Instructions**

  * Create two variables, called `name` and `country`, that will hold strings.

  * Create two variables, called `age` and `hourly_wage`, that will hold integers.

  * Create a variable called `satisfied`, which will hold a Boolean.

  * Create a variable called `daily_wage`, which will hold the value of `hourly_wage` multiplied by 8.

  * With an `f-string`, print the `daily_wage` and `satisfied` variables.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>‚≠ê 3.3 Review: Hello, Variable World (0:05)</strong></summary>

* Open [HelloVariableWorld.py](Activities/04-Stu_HelloVariableWorld/Solved/HelloVariableWorld.py), share the file with the students, and go over the solution file line by line with the class, answering whatever questions students may have.

* Cover the following key points during the discussion:

  * Each variable has to be declared individually but does not have to be cast at declaration. Python figures out the data type on its own.

  * Integer variables can be placed into calculations by using their name.

  * Even though Booleans look like strings, they do not use quotations in their declaration, as in the following image:

    ![Declaring Variables](Images/04-HelloVariableWorld_Variables.png)

  * When traditionally printing out integers and Booleans with strings, the variables must also be cast as strings. Without casting them as strings, the console will return an error.

  ```python
  # Print out the user's age
  print("You are " + str(age) + " years old")
  ```

  * When using an f-string, integers and Booleans do not need to be cast as strings. Also, the syntax is slightly different: variables are enclosed in curly braces, there are no plus signs, and there is a single set of quotation marks around the entire string.

  ```python
  # With an f-string, print out the daily wage that was calculated
  print(f"You make {daily_wage} per day")

  # With an f-string, print out whether the users were satisfied
  print(f"Are you satisfied with your current wage? {satisfied}")
  ```

## 4. Down to Input

| Activity Time:       0:20 |  Elapsed Time:      1:25  |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|

<details>
  <summary><strong>üì£ 4.1 Instructor Do: Inputs and Prompts (0:05)</strong></summary>

*  Continue through the slideshow to faciliate discussion of the next topic.

* Open [inputs.py](Activities/05-Ins_Prompts/Solved/inputs.py), then run the code within the terminal before opening the code in the text editor, as in the following image:

  ![input terminal](Images/inputs.png)

* Next, explain how the code completes the following actions:

  * It takes input from the command line after printing a prompt to the terminal.

  * The variable `name` will store the user's response to the prompt.

  * Every response to an input is stored as a string regardless of the characters entered. Therefore, variables that are intended as integers must be cast as integers to be used in calculations.

  * The `bool()` function always returns `True` if any text is inside of it; technically, any nonempty string will evaluate to `True`.

  * Print statements can be concatenated with variables as long as they are also strings or are cast as strings.

    ```python
    # Collects the user's input for the prompt "What is your name?"
    name = input("What is your name? ")

    # Collects the user's input for the prompt "How old are you?"
    # and converts the string to an integer.
    age = int(input("How old are you? "))

    # Collects the user's input for the prompt "Is input truthy?"
    # and converts it to a boolean.
    # Note that non-zero, non-empty objects are truth-y.
    trueOrFalse = bool(input("Is the input truthy? "))

    # Creates three print statements that respond with the output.
    print("My name is " + str(name))
    print("I will be " + str(age + 1) + " next year.")
    print("The input was converted to " + str(trueOrFalse))
    ```

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>‚úèÔ∏è 4.2 Students Do: Down to Input (0:10)</strong></summary>

* Continue through the slideshow, using the next slides as an accompaniment to this activity.

* This activity will give students a chance to work on storing inputs from the command line and running code based on the values entered.

* Open up [06-Stu_DownToInput](Activities/06-Stu_DownToInput/Solved/DownToInput.py) within the terminal, run the code, and discuss with students how the application should function. The following image captures the code:

  ![Down to Input Code](Images/06-DownToInput_Output.png)

* Then, send out the following instructions:

* **Instructions:**

  * Create two different variables, one to take the input of your first name and one for your neighbor's first name.

  * Create two more inputs to ask how many months you and your neighbor have been coding.

  * Finally, display a result with both your names and the total amount of months you‚Äôve been coding.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>‚≠ê 4.3 Review: Down to Input (0:05)</strong></summary>

* Open [DownToInput.py](Activities/06-Stu_DownToInput/Solved/DownToInput.py), send out the file, and go over the solution file line by line with the class, answering whatever questions students may have.

* Cover the following key points in your discussion:

  * We set the variables `your_first_name` and `neighbor_first_name` using two inputs; since they are strings, they will not need to be cast later on.

  * The `months_you_coded` and `months_neighbor_coded` are set using two more inputs. They have to be added together, so they will need to be cast as integers later on.

  * After calculating the total number of months, this new integer variable will have to be cast as a string to be printed, as in the following image:

    ![Input Code](Images/06-DownToInput_Code.png)

## 5. Conditional Conundrum

| Activity Time:       0:20 |  Elapsed Time:      1:45  |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|

<details>
  <summary><strong>üì£ 5.1 Instructor Do: Conditionals (0:05)</strong></summary>

* Continue the slideshow to facilitate discussion of the next topic.

* Open [conditionals.py](Activities/07-Ins_Conditionals/Solved/conditionals.py) in a text editor, and review the code with the class.

* Students should be familiar with conditionals from their time with VBA. Explain that the logic in Python is nearly the same; the primary differences are the syntax and indentation.

  * Python uses `if`, `elif`, and `else` to create conditionals. Emphasize that we should always pay attention to the letter case and spelling.

  * Conditional statements are concluded with a colon. Because Python reads blocks of code based on indentation, all lines after the colon **must** be indented to be considered a part of that code block, as in the following image:

    ![Python Indentation](Images/07-Conditionals_Indent.png)

  * All sorts of operators, including greater than, less than, and equal to, can be used to create logic tests for conditionals.

  * The condition `is equal to` uses `==`, while variable assignment uses one equal sign.

  * Multiple logic tests can be checked within a single conditional statement. If we use the term `and`, both tests must return `True`, while `or` requires that only one test return as true.

  * Conditionals can even be nested, allowing programmers to perform logic tests based on whether or not the original logic test returned as `True`, as in the following image:

    ![Conditional Code](Images/07-Conditionals_Code.png)

* Answer any questions that the class may have before sending out the code for students to reference during the next exercise.

<details>
  <summary><strong>‚úèÔ∏è 5.2 Students Do: Conditional Conundrum (0:10)</strong></summary>


* Continue through the slideshow, using the next slides as an accompaniment to this activity.

* During this activity, students will review prewritten conditionals and predict the lines that will be printed to the console.

* Send out the following file and instructions: 

* **File:**

  * [conditionals_unsolved.py](Activities/08-Stu_ConditionalConundrum/Unsolved/conditionals_unsolved.py)

* **Instructions:**

  * Go through the conditionals in the provided code, and predict what lines will be printed to the console.

  * Do not run the code at first. Try to follow the thought process for each chunk of code and then make a guess. Only after coming up with a guess for each section should you run the application.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>‚≠ê 5.3 Review: Conditionals Conundrum (0:05)</strong></summary>

* Open up the code contained within [08-Stu_conditionalConundrum](Activities/08-Stu_ConditionalConundrum/Solved/conditionals_solved.py), share the file, and go over the solution file line by line with the class, answering whatever questions students may have.

* Cover the following key points during your discussion:

  * The `if` statement for the first chunk of code, captured in the following image, checks whether `10 > 10`, which is false. Therefore, the code returns "ooo needs some work", as captured in the following image:

    ![First Chunk](Images/08-ConditionalsConundrum_FirstChunk.png)

  * In the second chunk of code, captured in the following image, the length of "Dog" is 3 and `x` is 5; thus, the statement for the second chunk of code is true, and the code will return "Question 2 works!", as captured in the following image:

    ![Second Chunk](Images/08-ConditionalsConundrum_SecondChunk.png)

  * The addition of the `and` statement to the third chunk of code, captured in the following image, means that both logic tests need to return `True` to run. Thankfully, both do, so "GOT QUESTION 3!" is printed, as captured in the following image:

    ![Third Chunk](Images/08-ConditionalsConundrum_ThirdChunk.png)

  * Conditionals work line by line. The logic tests in chunk four, captured in the following image, do not return as `True` until the third conditional; therefore, "Dan is in group three" is printed, as captured in the following image:

    ![Fourth Chunk](Images/08-ConditionalsConundrum_FourthChunk.png)

  * Within chunk five, captured in the following image, one of the conditions is met in the third conditional, but it's not until getting into the `or` statement of the fourth conditional that the logic test finally returns as `True`, as captured in the following image:

    ![Fifth Chunk](Images/08-ConditionalsConundrum_FifthChunk.png)

* Ask the class if anyone would like to share their creations from the bonus section of the activity.

  * Have students slack out their code and explain how their conditional puzzles worked with the class.

<details>
  <summary><strong>üì£ 6.1 Instructor Do: Lists (0:10)</strong></summary>

* Continue the slideshow to facilitate discussion of the next topic.

* Welcome students back from break, and let them know that **lists** are the next data type that we‚Äôll be covering.

  * Lists are the Python equivalent of arrays in VBA. Like arrays, lists hold multiple pieces of data within one variable.

  * Lists can hold multiple types of data, such as strings, integers, and Boolean values&mdash;all can be stored within a single list!

* Open and share [lists.py](Activities/09-Ins_List/Solved/lists.py), then explain how to create a list, called `myList`, with a mix of data types:

  * The `append` method can add elements to the end of a list.

  * The `index` method returns the numeric location of a given value within a list.

  * The `len` function returns the length of a list.

  * The `remove` method deletes a given value from a list.

  * The `pop` method can be used to remove a value by index.

    * Remind students that indexing in lists starts at `0`.
  
  * The following image captures the code for this demonstration.

  ![List Methods](Images/09-Lists_ListMethods.png)

* Python also has a data type called "tuples," which are functionally similar to lists in what they can store&mdash;but they are immutable.

  * Although lists in Python can be modified after their creation, tuples can never be modified after their declaration.

  * Tuples tend to be more efficient to navigate through than lists; they also protect the data stored within from being changed.

  * For more info on tuples, have your students check out this [quora question](https://www.quora.com/What-advantages-do-tuples-have-over-lists).

  * The following image captures how to create a tuple:

* Open [RPS_Solved.py](Activities/10-Stu_RockPaperScissors/Solved/RPS_Solved.py) within the terminal, then run and discuss the application, which is captured in the following image:

  ![RPS](Images/10-RPS_output.png)

* Open [RPS_Unsolved.py](Activities/10-Stu_RockPaperScissors/Unsolved/RPS_Unsolved.py) within a text editor, and tell students that this will be their starter code.

* Explain how the code imports a module called `random`, which will allow the computer to make a choice randomly from a list of actions.

* Mention to students that they will delve into modules during the next class.

* Direct the class to the [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/random.html) for the `random` module; explain how importing the `random` library will give them access to all these functions within their code.

* Then, send out the following file and instructions:

* **File**

  * [RPS_Unsolved.py](Activities/10-Stu_RockPaperScissors/Unsolved/RPS_Unsolved.py)

* **Instructions:**

  * Using the terminal, take an input of `r`, `p`, or `s` for rock, paper, or scissors.

  * Have the computer randomly pick one of these three choices.

  * Compare the user's input to the computer's choice to determine if the user won, lost, or tied.

  * **Hints:**

    * Look into this [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/306400/how-to-randomly-select-an-item-from-a-list) question for help with using the `random` module to select a value from a list.

  <summary><strong>‚≠ê 6.3 Review: Rock, Paper, Scissors (0:05)</strong></summary>

* Open up the code contained within [RPS_Solved.py](Activities/10-Stu_RockPaperScissors/Solved/RPS_Solved.py), share the file with students, and go over the solution file line by line with the class, answering whatever questions students may have.

* Cover the following key points during your discussion:

  * In the starter code, `random.choice` will make a random selection from the `options` list for the computer and then store its pick within a variable called `computer_choice`.

  * The application prompts the user for their option and stores it within a variable called `user_choice`.

  * Knowing that rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock, the code can be organized into a series of conditional statements to compare the user's choice to the computer's choice, as in the following image:

## 7. Number Chain

| Activity Time:       0:30 |  Elapsed Time:      3:00  |

  <summary><strong>üì£ 7.1 Instructor Do: Loops (0:10)</strong></summary>

* Continue the slideshow to facilitate discussion of the next topic.

* Although we covered loops during our VBA classes, students may struggle to grasp the corresponding Python syntax. Pause for questions as you proceed through the activity.

* Open up [11-Ins_Loops](Activities/11-Ins_Loops/Solved/LoopDeeLoop.py) within a text editor, and explain the following points:

  * The variable `x` is created within the loop statement and could theoretically take on any name as long as it is unique.

  * When looping through a range of numbers, Python will halt the loop one number before the final number. For example, when looping from 0 to 5, the code will run five times, but `x` will only ever be printed as 0 through 4.

  * When provided with a single number, `range()` will always start the loop at 0. However, when provided with two numbers, the code will loop from the first number until it reaches one fewer than the second number.

  * The following image captures code for range loops:

    ![Range Loops](Images/11-Loops_Range.png)

  * Python can also loop through all the letters within a string or all the values stored within a list by using the syntax `for <variable> in <string or list>:`, as in the following image:

    ![String Lists](Images/11-Loops_StringList.png)

  * `while` loops, captured in the following image, will run blocks of code just like a `for` loop, but they will continue looping for as long as a condition is met.

  <summary><strong>‚úèÔ∏è 7.2 Students Do: Number Chain - Loops (0:15)</strong></summary>

* Continue through the slideshow, using the next slides as an accompaniment to this activity.

* Next up, students will complete a number chain exercise that will take user input and print out a string of numbers. Feel free to add extra time to this exercise, as it is the last of the day and is critical to understanding how loops work.

* Open [NumberChain_Solved.py](Activities/12-Stu_NumberChain-Loops/Solved/NumberChain_Solved.py), and run and discuss the code, which is captured in the following GIF:

  ![Number Chain Basic](Images/numberchain-basic.gif)

* Then, send out the following instructions:

* **Instructions:**

  * Using a `while` loop, ask the user "How many numbers?", and then print out a chain of numbers in increasing order from 0 to the user-input number.

  * After the results have been printed, ask the user if they would like to continue. 
    * If "y" is entered, keep the chain running by inputting a new number and starting a new count from 0 to the new user-input number. 
    * If "n" is entered, exit the application.

  * **Bonus:**

    * Rather than just displaying numbers starting from 0, have the numbers begin at the end of the previous chain.

  <summary><strong>‚≠ê 7.3 Review: Number Chain (0:05)</strong></summary>

* Open up the code contained within [NumberChain_Solved.py](Activities/12-Stu_NumberChain-Loops/Solved/NumberChain_Solved.py), share the file with students, and go over the solution file line by line with the class, answering whatever questions students may have.

* For the regular solution, explain:

  * The initial value for `user_play` is set to "y" so the `while` loop will start running. This loop will continue to run as long as the value of `user_play` is "y" at the end of the code block.

  * An input number is asked for, and then a `for` loop will run to count from 0 to that number.

  * The user is then prompted to enter "y" if they would like to create a new number chain or "n" if they would like to terminate the application.

    ```python
    # Initial variable to track game play
    user_play = "y"

    # While we are still playing...
    while user_play == "y":

        # Ask the user how many numbers to loop through
        user_number = input("How many numbers? ")

        # Loop through the numbers. (Be sure to cast the string into an integer.)
        for x in range(int(user_number)):

            # Print each number in the range
            print(x)

        # Once complete...
        user_play = input("Continue: (y)es or (n)o? ")
    ```

* For the bonus solution, just add in a variable called `start_number` with an initial value of 1 and whose value will be set to the last number used in the loop after the `for` loop has completed.

  * The `for` loop will now run from the range of `start_number` to `user_number` plus `start_number`. Explain that this means that the code will always count up from the previous input amount to the new input amount.

  <summary><strong>Instructor Do: Preview the Homework</strong></summary>

* With any remaining time, give a preview of the homework. Explain that students will be reading from a CSV file and formulating the results using Python. Note that they will be given two datasets, and their scripts will need to work for each. Encourage them that they may not have all the tools to complete this homework after today's class, but they will by the end of the week.
