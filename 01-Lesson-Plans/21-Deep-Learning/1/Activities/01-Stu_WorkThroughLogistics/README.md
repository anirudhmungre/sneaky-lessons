# Work Through Logistics

In this activity, you'll use a logistic regression to categorize data from the `make_blobs` dataset.

## Instructions 

* Use the starter code provided to create your `make_blobs` dataset from Scikit-learn.

* Split your dataset into training and testing sets using Scikit-learn's `train_test_split` module.

* Create a LogisticRegression instance from Scikit-learn's `LogisticRegression` model.

* Train your `LogisticRegression` model on the training dataset.

* Evaluate your trained `LogisticRegression` model using the `accuracy_score` metric from Scikit-learn.

## Hint 

* If you need a reminder on how to create a `LogisticRegression` model, look at [Scikit-learn documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html).
