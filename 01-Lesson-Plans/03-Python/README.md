Each week, students review a Career Connection document in the [04-Career-Modules folder](../../04-Career-Modules/). This Career Connection relates this week's material to a professional setting, encourages students to complete certain Career Services tasks, and provides technical interviewing questions, where applicable, that the student can work through.

**If you haven't already done so, remember to push this entire folder for students to access.**

Remind students that related Career Services material can be found in this supplemental folder.

If you'd like more information on Career Services, visit the [Career Services resources page](https://mycareerspot.org/).
