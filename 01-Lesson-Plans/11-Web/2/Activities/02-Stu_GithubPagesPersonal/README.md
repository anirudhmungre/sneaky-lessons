# Deploying Personal Bios to GitHub Pages

In this activity, you will be deploying the bio pages you created on the previous activity to GitHub pages.

## Instructions

Now that we have gone over how to create a personal website using GitHub Pages, it is your turn to publish the bio you created. Once your personal webpage is live, slack it out so that everyone can see what you have made.

* Deployment Guide:

    * Create a new repository that is named _username_.github.io
    * Navigate into a folder and clone the repository into it. 
    * Add an HTML file named index.html and code out a basic webpage (or use a previous page)
    * Add, commit, and push your changes into the repository.
    * Navigate to _username_.github.io and you will find that your new web page has gone live!

## Bonus

* Add a few new pages to your website.

* Add extra tags and flesh your page out some more - give it some pop.
