* You are the owner of four cafés in a town of avid coffee drinkers.

* Using a Chi-square goodness-of-fit test, determine whether the results suggest that customers are more likely to frequent one cafe over another.

* Perform the necessary calculations by using Python.

* Then perform the calculations by hand to verify your findings.

* Use a p-value of 0.05.

* Consult a Chi-square table to find your critical value: <https://www.medcalc.org/manual/chi-square-table.php>
