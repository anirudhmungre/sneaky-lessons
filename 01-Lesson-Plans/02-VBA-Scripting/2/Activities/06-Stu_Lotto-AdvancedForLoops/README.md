# The VBA Lotto

For this activity, you're in charge of finding the winners of a local lottery.

## Instructions

The winning tickets are:

* First place: 3957481
* Second place: 5865187
* Third place: 2817729

Create a script that will return those lucky winners and print them on the sheet. Make sure to do the following:

* For each winner, include the following pieces of information: first name, last name, and the winning number. 

* Present the winners in order: first place, then second place, then third place.

* Create a message box that congratulates the first-place winner.

## Bonus

A last-minute consolation prize was added! Three wild ticket numbers were generated. Search for the following tickets to find the fourth-place (runner-up) winner. The first player to hold any one of these tickets is the runner-up. 

* 2275339
* 5868182
* 1841402

## Hints

* Remember to use variables to keep your code clean.

* For the bonus, you may need to use `Exit For`.
