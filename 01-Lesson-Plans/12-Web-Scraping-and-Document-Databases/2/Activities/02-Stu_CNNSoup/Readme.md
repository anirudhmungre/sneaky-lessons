# A Soup Starter

In this activity, you will take your first step in web scraping by taking an external HTML file, parsing it, and then printing out specific elements to the console.  

## Instructions

Believe it or not, CNN's website for **1996: Year in Review** is still alive on the web: <http://edition.cnn.com/EVENTS/1996/year.in.review/>

We have, however, stored the HTML document as a string in your starter file.

* Your task, should you accept it (and you should), is to use Beautiful Soup to scrape and print the following pieces of information:

    * The **title**.
    * All **paragraph** texts.
    * The top 10 headlines (warning: this one is a bit tricky, and may not come out perfectly!).

## Hint

* For the third task, you will need a means of filtering the data, perhaps over multiple iterations.

## Bonus

* If you finish early, head over to the [Beautful Soup documentation](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) to read up on accessing `attributes` and navigating the DOM.
