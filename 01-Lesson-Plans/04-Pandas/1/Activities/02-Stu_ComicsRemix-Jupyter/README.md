# Comic Book Remix

For this activity, you will be creating a Jupyter notebook that performs the same functions as the Comic Book activity from last week.

## Instructions

* Using `comicbooks.py` as a starting point, convert the application so that it runs properly within a Jupyter Notebook.

* Have the application print out the user's input, the path to `comic_books.csv`, and the publisher/date published for the book in different cells.

## Bonus

* Go through any of the activities from last week, and attempt to convert them to run within a Jupyter Notebook. As you go, try to split up the code into cells and print out the outputs.
