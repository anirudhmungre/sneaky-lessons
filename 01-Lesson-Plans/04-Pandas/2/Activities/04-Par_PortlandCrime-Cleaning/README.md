# Portland Crime

In this activity, you will take a crime dataset from Portland, OR, and clean it up so that the DataFrame is consistent and does not have any rows with missing data.

## Instructions

* Read in the CSV using Pandas, and print out the DataFrame that is returned.

* Get a count of the rows within the DataFrame to determine if there are any null values.

* Drop the rows that contain null values.

* Search through the "Offense Type" column, and replace any similar values with one consistent value.

* Create a couple DataFrames that look into one Neighborhood only, and print them to the screen.
