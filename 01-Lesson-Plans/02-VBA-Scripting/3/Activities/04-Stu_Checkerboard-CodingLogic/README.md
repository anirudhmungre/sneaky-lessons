# Checkerboard Layout

In this activity, you will work with a partner to create a checkerboard.

## Instructions

Using VBA scripts, create an 8-by-8 grid with alternating red and black squares.

## Hints

* You will need to use nested `for` loops, conditionals, the `MOD` function, and formatting to create the board.

* This is a tricky problem! Try to pseudocode a plan first.

* Unlike previous activities, this one can be solved in many different ways. While some methods may be more efficient, simply finding a solution to the problem is a great start!
