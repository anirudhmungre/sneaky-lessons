# Banking Deserts Heatmap

In this activity your broad task is to answer the question: "What is the relationship between poverty, age, and population with the number of banks in a given area?" To help accomplish this task, you've been given census data for every zip code across the country. We will also visualize this data by creating layered maps with Google maps.

## Instructions

* Using [zip_bank_data.csv](Resources/zip_bank_data.csv) and your new knowledge of the US Census API, add a column for Poverty Rate to the csv.

* Using `gmap` create the following three figures:

  * A map with a `heatmap_layer` of the poverty rate for each city.
    ![Heatmap Layer](Images/heatmap.png)

  * A map with a `symbol_layer` for the number of banks located at that city.
    ![Symbol Layer](Images/bank_map.png)

  * A map that includes both the poverty `heatmap_layer` and the bank `symbol_layer`.
    ![Combined Map](Images/final_map.png)

* Print the summary statistics for poverty rate, bank count and population.

* Create a scatter plot with linear regression for **bank count** vs. **poverty rate**.

  * Be sure NaN values are dropped from the DataFrame.

  * Plot the data points.

  * Plot the linear regression line.

  * Print the R-squared value.

* Write a sentences describing your findings. Were they what you expected? What other factors could be at play?

## Hint

* The Census API uses code `B17001_002E` for poverty rates.

* Test your code with only 5-10 cities at a time while debugging your code.

* For reference, use the docs for the [layers](http://jupyter-gmaps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#figures-and-layers) and as a [refresher](http://jupyter-gmaps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html) for setting up the maps.

* Be sure to handle zoom on the heat map.

* At this point, you should not need to perform any new requests to Google's APIs.

* To format the info boxes on your symbol_layer, look to use string formatting with list comprehension.
