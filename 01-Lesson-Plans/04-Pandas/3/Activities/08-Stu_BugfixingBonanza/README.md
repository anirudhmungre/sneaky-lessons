# Bug-Fixing Bonanza!

In this activity, you will be provided with a Pandas project that contains TONS of bugs. Your job is to take the application and fix it up so that it works properly.

## Instructions

* Dig through the provided Jupyter notebook, and attempt to fix as many bugs as possible. There are a lot, and the bugs get harder to resolve as the code progresses.

* Once you have finished bugfixing, perform some additional analysis on the provided dataset. What interesting theories and/or conclusions can you draw about bedbugs in New York City? As long as you keep challenging yourself, bugs will pop up and you’ll get more bugfixing practice.

* Consider other possible questions and what additional data you could search for in order to draw further conclusions from this data.

## Hint

* After fixing the bugs in each block of code, make sure to run the cell below for an updated error.

* There are a few new concepts being covered within this Jupyter Notebook. The most complex of these concepts is multi-indexing, and it is very likely that this is where many will get held up. Don’t worry: Multi-indexing is not in the homework, and it is not required outside of this activity. It is simply an interesting, powerful feature of Pandas.
