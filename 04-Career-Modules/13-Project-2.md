# Career Connection

This week you covered a very important topic—ETL. It's a vital skill set to have as you start talking with prospective employers! So when you go out on that job interview, remember to tell the interviewer what you can do for their data.

Before we dive into some technical content, let’s take a look at a couple of things you can do this week to start discovering professional opportunities.

## Employer-Competitive Advantage

Are you already looking at companies that you'd like to interview with? If not, then start with Step 1. If you already have a list of companies that you're interested in working for in the future, jump over to Step 2.

### Step 1

Head over to [LinkedIn Jobs]() and add some search terms into the "Search jobs" field. Some options include: data engineer, data analyst, Python developer, and ETL developer. In the location field, add either your current location or the place you would like to work in and hit "Search":

Write down the names of 3-4 companies that have open positions that you've either heard of or seem like places (from the job description) you'd like to work at.

### Step 2

Using one of the companies you'd like to work at, locate their homepage. Once on their homepage, see what you can find out about their current initiatives. Who are the key players at the company? Is there a contact for HR or recruitment? Do they have an internal job board? Note anything of interest about the company.

## Technical Interview

Here are some important ETL questions that you should know the answer to. See if you can figure out the right answer and jot it down in a notebook or in a text editor. Once you’re done, take a look at the solution.

- What is ETL?
  - ETL stands for Extract, Transform, Load; it is a process for collecting, cleaning, and saving data. The Extract step reads data from disparate data sources, while the Transform step converts the data into a useful format, and the Load step writes that data into the target database or data warehouse.
- What are regular expressions and why would you want to use them?
  - Regular expressions are a sequence of specific characters that help match or find other strings, or sets of strings, using specialized syntax. Often shortened to “RegEx,” they can be used with the Python package “re.”
- Define a lambda function and give an example.
  - A lambda function is a short, anonymous function; it can take any number of arguments but only has one expression.
  - Compare your example with something offered earlier in this week’s material.
