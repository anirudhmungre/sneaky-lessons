# Hockey Headers

Teamwork! Speed! Mental and physical toughness! Passion! Excitement! Unpredictable matchups down to the wire! What could be better? While these terms could easily be applied to a data science hackathon, we're talking about the magnificent sport of hockey.

Your assignment is to scrape the articles on the news page of the NHL website - which is frequently updated - and then post the results of your scraping to MongoDB.

## Instructions

* Use Beautiful Soup and requests to scrape the header and subheader of each article on the news page.

* Post the above information as a MongoDB document and then print all of the documents on the database to the console.

* In addition to the above, post the date of the article publication as well.
