# Contributing to the Curriculum

:+1::tada: Thank you for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

Most of what you need to know about contributing can be found in our general [Curriculum Contributing Guide](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/curriculum-dev-docs/blob/master/guides/Contributing.md).

It includes links to our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/curriculum-dev-docs/blob/master/CodeOfConduct.md), which all contributors are expected to follow, and our [Style Guide](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/curriculum-dev-docs/blob/master/guides/Contributing.md#styleguides) which outlines our expectations regarding the look and feel of our code and repositories.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out and/or open an issue!
