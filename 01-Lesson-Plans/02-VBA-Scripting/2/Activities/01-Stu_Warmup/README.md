# Budget Checker

In this activity, you'll write a VBA script to run a budget checker in Excel.

## Instructions

* There are three parts to this problem.

  * Part 1: Calculate the total amount after adding in the fee, and enter the value in the "Total" cell.

  * Part 2: Create a message box to alert the user if the total amount, including the fee, is within or over budget.

  * Part 3 (Challenge): If the total is over budget, correct the price so it fits within the user’s budget. Be sure to round down! 
    
    * For example: If the user's budget is 100 and the fees are 15%, the max price should be 86.

## Hints

* Break up the problem into smaller steps.

* Look at old code! You got this!
