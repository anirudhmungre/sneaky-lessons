# PCA in Action

In this activity, you will use PCA to reduce the dimensions of the consumers shopping dataset from `4` to `2` features. After applying PCA, you will use the principal components data to fit a k-means model with `k=3` and make some conclusions.

## Instructions

* Load the dataset.

* If necessary, standardize the data of all the features.

* Apply PCA to reduce the dataset to two dimensions.

* Compute the explained variance.
 
* Is the explained variance sufficiently high at `n_components=2`? If not, try reducing to three dimensions instead.

* Train the k-means algorithm with the reduced data at `k=3`.

## Bonus

* Install Plotly for Python in your current virtual environment. Uncomment and run the code at the end of the notebook to visualize the dataset in three dimensions.
