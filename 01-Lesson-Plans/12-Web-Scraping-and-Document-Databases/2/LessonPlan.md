# 12.2 Web Scraping

## Overview

Today's lesson dives into scraping websites with the Beautiful Soup library for Python. Students will start out scraping simple HTML strings before moving onto live web pages.

## Class Objectives

* Students will be able to use Beautiful Soup to scrape their own data from the web.
* Students will learn to save the results of web scraping into MongoDB.

## Instructor Prep

<details>
  <summary><strong>Instructor Priorities</strong></summary>

* Today's lesson relies upon scraping websites and, as such, students may find themselves blocked if a large portion of them choose to scrape the same website. If this happens, turn it into a learning opportunity and discuss how some sites keep track of requests to their sites and block IP addresses if hit too many times.

# Class Activities

## 1. CNN Soup

| Activity Time:       0:35 |  Elapsed Time:      0:35  |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|

<details>
  <summary><strong>📣 1.1 Instructor Do: Introduction to Beautiful Soup (0:10)</strong></summary>

* Let the class know that today will serve as a brief introduction to Python's Beautiful Soup library, an extremely powerful - albeit strangely named - tool for web scraping.

* Open the [slideshow](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13y-zxFjmDdW8J0FWDn8cbc1AOOS78B-renQpaY58zUg/edit?usp=sharing) and use slides 1 - 9 to assist you to introduce Beautiful Soup to the class.

  * Up to this point, the class has been force to rely upon analyzing web APIs and pre-existing data sets. From this day forth, however, students will know how to collect data from web resources that do not offer a full and convenient way to access to their data.

* Beautiful Soup has to be installed before Python can use it. To do this simply run `pip install bs4` within the terminal.

* Open up [01-Ins_SoupIntro](Activities/01-Ins_SoupIntro/Unsolved/IntroToSoup.ipynb) within Jupyter Notebook, going through the code within line-by-line with the class and answering whatever questions students may have.

  * The line `from bs4 import BeautifulSoup as bs` is used to import the Beautiful Soup library into the application.

  * In this example, Beautiful Soup will be working with some basic HTML that is stored as a string. Let the class know that this is being used instead of an external HTML file at the moment.

  * A Beautiful Soup object is parsed/created using `bs(html_string, 'html.parser')` and the object returned is assigned to the `soup` variable.

  * Remind students that the DOM is a tree whose structure is defined by the nesting of tags. Beautiful Soup looks through this tree and then converts it into a specialized object equipped with powerful methods for traversing and searching the HTML for attributes, text, etc.

  * The `type(soup)` method being used confirms that the `soup` object created is indeed a BeautifulSoup object.

  * The `prettify()` method of the Beautiful Soup library is then used to return a formatted version of the object that is easier to read.

    ![HTML String and Parsing](Images/01-IntroSoup_HTMLString.png)

* Now demonstrate how different parts of the HTML can be extracted using dot notation.

  * Begin by extracting the title element of the HTML document using `soup.title`. This returns the entire HTML element, including the tags themselves.

  * If the developer only desires to collect the text contained within the title element and nothing else, they can simply add `.text` to the end of their call. This will return the string surrounded by whitespace.

  * The text can be further cleaned by adding `.strip()` onto the end of the chain. Now the text value will be on its own.

    ![Title Element](Images/01-IntroSoup_TitleElement.png)

* Demonstrate to the class how the HTML's body can be collected, referenced, and printed to the screen.

  * Using `soup.body`, Python developers can print out the entire body of an HTML file with each element's tags included. Adding `.text` and `.strip()` to the end of the chain will further parse down the values returned.

  * Using the line `soup.body.p.text`, the text for only the first paragraph will be collected. Adding `.strip()` to the end of this chain will remove the whitespace as well.

    ![Collect Paragraph Text](Images/01-IntroSoup_AllParagraphs.png)

  * The `find_all(<ELEMENT>)` method returns a list containing all of the HTML elements of a specific type. As such, every paragraph (`<p>`) element on a page can be collected using `soup.body.find_all('p')`.

  * Index numbers can then be used to access the paragraph elements in a targeted fashion. Thus allowing developers to target more than the first instance of an element.

    ![Target Paragraph](Images/01-IntroSoup_TargetParagraph.png)

* Answer whatever questions students may have before moving onto the next activity.

  <summary><strong>✏️ 1.2 Students Do: CNN Soup (0:15)</strong></summary>

* In this activity, students will take their first steps in web scraping by taking an external HTML file, parsing it, and then printing out specific elements to the console.

* Open the [slideshow](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13y-zxFjmDdW8J0FWDn8cbc1AOOS78B-renQpaY58zUg/edit?usp=sharing) and use slides 10 and 11 to introduce this activity to the class.

  ![CNN Soup - Output](Images/02-CNNSoup_Output.png)

* **Files**:

  * [Stu_CNN-Unsolved.ipynb](Activities/02-Stu_CNNSoup/Unsolved/Stu_CNN-Unsolved.ipynb)

* **Instructions**:

  * Believe it or not, CNN's website for [1996: Year in Review](http://edition.cnn.com/EVENTS/1996/year.in.review/) is still alive on the web! We have, however, stored the HTML document as a string in your starter file.

  * Your task, should you accept it (and you should), is to use Beautiful Soup to scrape and print the following pieces of information:

  1. The title of the webpage

  2. All paragraph texts on the page

  3. The top 10 headlines for the year. This last one is a bit tricky and may not come out perfectly!

* **Hint**:

  * For the third task in this activity you will need a means of filtering the data... Perhaps over multiple iterations... With a loop... HINT HINT!

* **Bonus**:

  * If you finish early, head over to the [Beautful Soup documentation](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) to read up on accessing attributes and navigating the DOM.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>⭐ 1.3 Review: CNN Soup (0:10)</strong></summary>

* Open up [Stu_CNN.ipynb](Activities/02-Stu_CNNSoup/Solved/Stu_CNN.ipynb) within Jupyter Notebook and go through the code line-by-line with the class, answering whatever questions students may have and hitting upon the following points.

* Open the [slideshow](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13y-zxFjmDdW8J0FWDn8cbc1AOOS78B-renQpaY58zUg/edit?usp=sharing) and leave slide 12 open while you review this activity.

  * Finding the `title` of the document is very easy. Simply use `soup.title.text` and the HTML file's title element will have been collected.

  * To print all the paragraphs, `soup.find_all('p')` can be used and before looping over the results to print their text to the console.

    ![Title and Paragraphs](Images/02-CNNSoup_TitleAndPara.png)

  * The final part is a bit trickier. Users should initially find all `td` elements in the HTML document and then, as they loop over them, select only cells that contain a child `anchor` element.

  * Note the use of short-circut logic to check if `td.a` and `td.a.text` exist. Only if the element passes these two tests will its contents be added into the headlines list.

  * Finally, only the first 10 items within the headlines list are printed since other headlines on the page made it through the last step as well.

## 2. Reddit Scraper

| Activity Time:       0:35 |  Elapsed Time:      1:10  |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|

<details>
  <summary><strong>📣 2.1 Instructor Do: Computer Wishlist (0:05)</strong></summary>

* Open the [slideshow](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13y-zxFjmDdW8J0FWDn8cbc1AOOS78B-renQpaY58zUg/edit?usp=sharing) and use slides 13 - 17 to present this unit to the class.

* So far the class has only parsed HTML strings with Beautiful Soup. Now it is time to scrape a live website!

* Explain that the first site to scrape will be a test site where we will simulate shopping for a computer (`https://webscraper.io/test-sites/e-commerce/allinone/computers/laptops`).

  * The goal will be to scrape the results for an item - such as a computer - on the test site and return each relevant listing's title, price, and link.

* Now open up [Ins_Commerce.ipynb](Activities/03-Ins_Commerce/Solved/Ins_Commerce.ipynb) go through the code with the class, answering whatever questions students may have.

  * Explain how the `requests` module is used to obtain the HTML object. Beautiful Soup then parses the returned object and converts it for further use.

  ```python
  # Dependencies
  from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
  import requests

  # URL of page to be scraped
  url = 'https://webscraper.io/test-sites/e-commerce/allinone/computers/laptops'

  # Retrieve page with the requests module
  response = requests.get(url)

  # Create BeautifulSoup object; parse with 'html.parser'
  soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
  ```

  * The Beautiful Soup object is then pretty-printed to the console for analysis. This allows the developer to search through the source code and find what elements they wish to grab.

  * Another method of examining the HTML is to navigate to the webpage itself and open up the page's source within the inspector.

  * Through analysis of the HTML code, one finds that data desired is being stored within the HTML in a `div` element with a class of "caption." The title of the item is within an anchor element whose class is "title."

    ![Source HTML](Images/03-Commerce_Source.png)

  * The listing price can also be found to exist within an `h4` element whose class is `price`.

  * To actually retrieve the contents of these elements, a `find_all('div', class_='caption')` method can be called on the `soup` object.

  * Print out all of the `results` and a Python list of all the computer listings from the query will be printed to the console.

    ![Commerce Results](Images/03-Commerce_Results.png)

  * By iterating through the listings, specific information can then be pulled from the Beautiful Soup object.

  * Each listing's title can therefore be gathered using `result.find('a', class_='title').text`, their prices collected with `result.find('h4', class_='price').text`, and their links retrieved by accessing the "href" attribute of each listing using `result.a['href']`.

  * Point out that an element's attributes are accessed using the square bracket notation.

  ```python
  # Loop through returned results
  for result in results:
      # Error handling
      try:
          # Identify and return title of listing
          title = result.find('a', class_='title').text
          # Identify and return price of listing
          price = result.find('h4', class_='price').text
          # Identify and return link to listing
          link = result.a['href']
  ```

* Displaying the results collected is as simple as printing the data to console as they are collected.

```python
# Print results only if title, price, and link are available
        if (title and price and link):
            print('-------------')
            print(title)
            print(price)
            print(link)
    except AttributeError as e:
        print(e)
```

* Answer whatever questions the class may have before moving onto the next activity.

  <summary><strong>✏️ 2.2 Students Do: Reddit Scraper (0:20)</strong></summary>

* In this activity, students will scrape the Python Reddit for potentially interesting content. They will also have to filter for threads with twenty or more comments in them.

* Open the [slideshow](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13y-zxFjmDdW8J0FWDn8cbc1AOOS78B-renQpaY58zUg/edit?usp=sharing) and use slides 18 and 19 to present this activity to the class.

  ![Reddit Scrape - Output](Images/04-RedditScrape_Output.png)

* **Instructions**:

* In this activity, you will scrape the Programmer-Humor.html file provided

* Use Beautiful Soup to scrape only threads that have twenty or more comments, then print the thread's title, number of comments, and the URL to the thread.

* **Bonus**

* If you finish early, try to display each thread's top comment in your output!

* As an added bonus try re-scraping using the URL instead. What happens when you try to do this? Why might this be happening?

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>⭐ 2.3 Review: Reddit Scraper (0:10)</strong></summary>

* Open the [slideshow](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13y-zxFjmDdW8J0FWDn8cbc1AOOS78B-renQpaY58zUg/edit?usp=sharing) and leave slide 20 open while you review this activity.

* There are many possible solutions to the activity. Explain that this is only one of them!

* Open up the [Programmer-Humor.html](Activities/04-Stu_RedditScrape/Solved/Programmer-Humor.html) in Chrome inspector and spend a minute or two parsing the information needed for this scraping activity. Explain:

  * Even though there is no CSS file attached to create the layout the class names still included in the HTML.

  * We can still search for a class tags in the HTML file.

* Explain that with Beautiful Soup's `find_all()` method, we retrieve all the entries on the page whose class is `top-matter`:

  ```python
  results = soup.find_all('div', class_='top-matter')
  ```

* We're then able to loop through the `results` to find each thread's title, number of comments, and the URL:

  ```python
  title = result.find('p', class_='title')
  title_text = title.a.text

  thread = result.find('li', class_='first')
  comments = thread.text

  link = thread.a['href']
  ```

* Explain that we also may also, optionally, elect to sort the results by the number of comments in the future. Accordingly, we need to parse the string containing the number of comments, e.g. "45 comments":

  ```python
  comments_num = int(comments.split()[0])
  ```

* First we split the string, then transform the number string into an integer.

* For the bonus, explain that we would have had to perform a second request with each thread's URL, using `requests`, made a second Beautiful Soup object, and retrieved the first comment.

* Explain that scraping the given HTML file was with an older version of a reddit webpage that was easy to scrape. When using the URL to request the most recent version of the web page we see that the results are very different.

* This is because websites are constantly changing, and Reddit may be using non English-like class names in an attempt to make the webpage harder to scrape. Instances like this are one of the shortcomings of web scraping.

* Answer any questions before moving on.

|---------------------------|---------------------------|

<details>
  <summary><strong>📣 3.1 Instructor Do: Mongo Scrape (0:10)</strong></summary>

* Open up [Ins_MongoScraping.ipynb](Activities/05-Ins_MongoScraping/Solved/Ins_MongoScraping.ipynb) and explain to the class how they will now learn how to translate the results of a web scraper to a MongoDB database.

* To assist you presenting this unit to the class open the [slideshow](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13y-zxFjmDdW8J0FWDn8cbc1AOOS78B-renQpaY58zUg/edit?usp=sharing) and use slides 21 - 24.

  * The application starts out by importing the relevant dependencies, initializing Pymongo, and defining the MongoDB database and collection.

  * Explain that, instead of `html.parser`, the `lxml` parser is being used. Send out [this link](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#installing-a-parser) to the class which provides an informative table on the various parsers available to Beautiful Soup and explain that some parsers are more flexible with parsing HTML than others.

  * Students may need to install the `lxml` module with `pip install lxml` from their console for this parser to function.

  ```python
  # Dependencies
  from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
  import requests
  import pymongo

  # Initialize PyMongo to work with MongoDBs
  conn = 'mongodb://localhost:27017'
  client = pymongo.MongoClient(conn)

  # Define database and collection
  db = client.commerce_db
  collection = db.items

  # URL of page to be scraped
  url = 'https://webscraper.io/test-sites/e-commerce/allinone/computers/laptops'

  # Retrieve page with the requests module
  response = requests.get(url)
  # Create BeautifulSoup object; parse with 'lxml'
  soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'lxml')
  ```

  * Much of the code is familiar to the earlier example from the computer purchasing test site. Explain that as the application loops through the results of the `soup` object it is simply gathering the information into a dictionary and then posting it to the mongoDB database.

  ```python
  # Examine the results, then determine element that contains sought info
  # results are returned as an iterable list
  results = soup.find_all('div', class_='caption')

  # Loop through returned results
  for result in results:
      # Error handling
      try:
          # Identify and return title of listing
          title = result.find('a', class_='title').text
          # Identify and return price of listing
          price = result.find('h4', class_='price').text
          # Identify and return link to listing
          link = result.a['href']

          # Run only if title, price, and link are available
          if (title and price and link):
              # Print results
              print('-------------')
              print(title)
              print(price)
              print(link)

              # Dictionary to be inserted as a MongoDB document
              post = {
                  'title': title,
                  'price': price,
                  'url': link
              }

              collection.insert_one(post)

      except Exception as e:
          print(e)
  ```

  * After the application has pushed all of the scraped data into the Mongo database, this can be verified by querying the database one and printing out all of the results to the console.

  ```python
  # Display items in MongoDB collection
  listings = db.items.find()

  for listing in listings:
      print(listing)
  ```

  * Alternatively, the user could also query the database from the console... if they really wanted to.

    ![Query From Console](Images/05-MongoScraping_Console.png)

* Run through the code one more time with the class, having students explain the function of each code block to the best of their ability.

  * Answer whatever questions students may have before moving onto the next activity.

* **Instructions**:

  * Teamwork! Speed! Mental and physical toughness! Passion! Excitement! Unpredictable matchups down to the wire! What could be better? While these terms could easily be applied to a data science hackathon, we're talking about the magnificent sport of hockey.

  * Your assignment is to scrape the articles on the news page of the [NHL website](https://www.nhl.com/news) - which is frequently updated - and then post the results of your scraping to MongoDB.

  * Use Beautiful Soup and requests to scrape the header and subheader of each article on the front page.

  * Post the above information as a MongoDB document and then print all of the documents on the database to the console.

  * In addition to the above, post the date of the article publication as well.

* **Files:** [Stu_Hockey.ipynb](Activities/06-Stu_HockeyHeaders/Solved/Stu_Hockey.ipynb)

* The main focus of this activity was for students to post scraped data into MongoDB. Do not spend excessive time on the minute details of the activity.

* During review, emphasize the broad strokes of the steps we took. We examined the inspector for HTML elements to scrape, extracted their text, then posted them to MongoDB.

* For the timestamp, it should suffice to explain simply that we find the string element then slice parts of it to re-compose it to fit our needs.

  <summary><strong>📣 4.1 Instructor Do: Introduction to Splinter (0:15)</strong></summary>

* Open the [slideshow](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13y-zxFjmDdW8J0FWDn8cbc1AOOS78B-renQpaY58zUg/edit?usp=sharing) and use slides 29 - 33 to assist you to present this unit to the class.

* **Important**: Have students install the web-driver manager into their virtual environments.

  ```bash
  pip install webdriver_manager
  ```

* Up to this point, students have used Beautiful Soup to scrape a single, static page at a time.

  * Point out that, often, developers can only access interesting parts of a website after engaging in some kind of interaction with it.

  * Point out that, typically, these interactions are pretty easy to automate: Logging in, filling out and submitting forms, etc.

  * Explain that when the data is "buried" behind such dynamic interactions, a web driver can be used to write scripts for the browser!

  * Explain that this allows developers to simulate user interactions programmatically and scrape multiple pages along the way.

* Open up [Ins_Splinter.ipynb](Activities/07-Ins_Splinter/Solved/Ins_Splinter.ipynb) and explain that Splinter is a Python module that automates browser actions such as visiting a URL, filling fields, and clicking buttons. It can be a very useful tool in the web scraper's arsenal!

  * Go to <http://quotes.toscrape.com/>, a sample page to practice web scraping. At the bottom is a `Next` button. Explain that the application we are using will use Splinter to click these buttons and scrape each page.

    ![Splinter In Control](Images/07-Splinter_Automatic.png)

  * From the console, run the code, and show the results to the class.

    ![Images/splinter2.png](Images/07-Splinter_Console.png)

  * Each quote on a page is displayed along with its page number! Awesome!

* Walk through the code contained within with the class, explaining the application line-by-line.

  * As per usual, the application starts by importing in all of the dependencies needed.

  * The web driver manager imports `ChromeDriverManager` which is setup and used to create an instance of a Splinter browser. `False` is passed for the `headless` option, which means that the browser's actions will be displayed in a Chrome window so that the process can be seen.

  ```python
  executable_path = {'executable_path': ChromeDriverManager().install()}
  browser = Browser('chrome', **executable_path, headless=False)
  ```

  * The specified URL is then accessed and visited.

  ```python
  url = 'http://quotes.toscrape.com/'
  browser.visit(url)
  ```

  * Explain that for each page, developers will need to parse and display that site's contents, i.e. quotes. The browser then need to click the `Next` button to proceed onto the next page to collect the next collection of quotes.

  * Open the Chrome inspector to identify the element that the application will need to click.

    ![Next Page](Images/07-Splinter_NextButton.png)

  * Navigate to [Splinter's documentation](https://splinter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/elements-in-the-page.html) and inform the class that Splinter offers various ways of interacting with the page, including clicking an element by its text.

  * The next part is a for-loop with five iterations that uses Beautiful Soup to parse the page by collecting all of the quotes in that location.

  * Additionally, after printing all the quotes on a page, the application clicks on the `Next` button with Splinter's `links.find_by_partial_text()` method and then chain the `.click()` method to click on the "Next" button.

  ```python
  for x in range(1, 6):

      html = browser.html
      soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')

      quotes = soup.find_all('span', class_='text')

      for quote in quotes:
          print('page:', x, '-------------')
          print(quote.text)

      browser.links.find_by_partial_text('Next').click()
  ```

  * Finally, explain that there are ten total pages on this practice website, but that this application arbitrarily chose five as the number of pages to cycle through.

* Answer any questions that students may have. In the next activity, they will be able to practice dynamic webscraping.

* Open the [slideshow](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13y-zxFjmDdW8J0FWDn8cbc1AOOS78B-renQpaY58zUg/edit?usp=sharing) and leave slide 36 open while you review this activity.

* **File:** [Stu_Splinter.ipynb](Activities/08-Stu_Splinter/Unsolved/Stu_Splinter.ipynb)

* Here are some highlights to consider for the review.

* We iterate through each page and retrieve the HTML object, which we parse with Beautiful Soup. Using the browser inspector, we identify elements that contain information for each book, which we call `articles` in this case:

  ```python
  for x in range(50):
      html = browser.html
      soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')
      articles = soup.find_all('article', class_='product_pod')
  ```

* Inside the above loop, we simply navigate inside each `article`, first finding its first `h3` element, then the latter's first anchor, or `a` element. We then retrieve the attributes of the anchor element, including its `href` and `title`:

  ```python
  for article in articles:
      h3 = article.find('h3')
      link = h3.find('a')
      href = link['href']
      title = link['title']
      print('-----------')
      print(title)
      print('http://books.toscrape.com/'+ href)
  ```

* Answer any questions before moving on.

  <summary><strong>📣 5.1 Instructor Do: Pandas Scraping (0:10)</strong></summary>

* Open the [slideshow](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13y-zxFjmDdW8J0FWDn8cbc1AOOS78B-renQpaY58zUg/edit?usp=sharing) and use slides 37 - 45 to present this unit to the class.

* **Files**:

  * [Ins_Pandas_Scraping.ipynb](Activities/09-Ins_Pandas_Scraping/Solved/Ins_Pandas_Scraping.ipynb)

* Explain that Pandas actually has some built-in scraping capabilities.

* Visit the Wikipedia article [List of capitals in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_capitals_in_the_United_States) to show students the data table listed in the article.

* Explain we can use the `read_html` function in Pandas to try and parse tabular data from HTML.

* Scroll through the table data that `read_html` collects from  the wikipedia article.

  ![read_html_output_2.png](Images/read_html_output_2.png)

* Students may be surprised to see that multiple sections of data were returned from the list. This may be a good time to poll students for their theories on what the data is.

* Print the `type` of the _tables_ variable to show that the return value of `read_html` is a list.

  ![tables_type_2.png](Images/tables_type_2.png)

* Explain that `read_html` actually tries to convert as much of the HTML into DataFrames as possible and therefore returns a list of DataFrames.

* Show that we can use list indexing to grab a reference to the DataFrame that we are interested about.

  ![dataframe_from_list_2.png](Images/dataframe_from_list_2.png)

* Explain that we often have to do a lot of data cleaning on these scraped DataFrames. Quickly walk the students through examples of setting, dropping, slicing the columns, deleting header rows, and resetting indexes.

  ![split_column.png](Images/split_column.png)

  ![drop_column.png](Images/drop_column.png)

  ![reset_index.png](Images/reset_index.png)

* Show students the DataFrame data for one of the states using `loc`.

  ![newYork.png](Images/newYork.png)

* Explain that we can also convert DataFrames back to HTML tables using the `to_html` function.

  ![dataframe_to_html_2.png](Images/dataframe_to_html_2.png)

* Explain that we may need to use `replace` to remove extra newlines from the code.

  ![replace_2.png](Images/replace_2.png)

* Finally, explain that we can also save the HTML table to a file. After running `df.to_html('table.html')`, open the file in the browser to show students the table rendered as HTML in the browser.
