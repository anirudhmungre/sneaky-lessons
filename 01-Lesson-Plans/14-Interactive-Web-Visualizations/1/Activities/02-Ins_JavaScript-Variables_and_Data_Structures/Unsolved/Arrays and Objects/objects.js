// objects are collections of properties. Properties are key-value pairs


// to access a property from a JavaScript object, there are two options
// 1) Bracket notation, similar to python
// output: "Chicago"

// 2) Dot notation (the preferred convention in JavaScript)
// output: "Illinois"

// properties can be overwritten by assigning a new value


// to add a property to an existing object, simply assign a value to a new key
