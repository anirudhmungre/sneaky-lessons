# Rendering a Homepage

In this activity, you will create a webpage rendering a string with Flask. 

## Instructions

* In `app.py`, create a home route that returns `name` and `hobby` variables.

* In `index.html`, create a header with a welcome message that incorporates the `name` variable and a paragraph that displays the `hobby` variable returned from the back end.

## Bonus

* Create a `bonus.html` page and a link to it in `index.html`. In `bonus.html`, add a link back to the home page.

* Create a new route in `app.py` that will route users to `bonus.html` and will return both `name` and `hobby` from the back end.

## Hint

* Consult the [Flask Render Docs](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/quickstart/#rendering-templates) for reference.
