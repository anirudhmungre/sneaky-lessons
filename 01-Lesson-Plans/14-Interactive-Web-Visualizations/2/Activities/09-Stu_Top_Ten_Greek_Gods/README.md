# Sorting and Slicing with Plotly

In this activity, you will sort, slice, and reverse the [data.js](Unsolved/data.js) dataset to build a horizontal bar chart of the top 10 Greek god search results.

## Instructions

* Sort the data by Greek search results in descending order.

* Slice the first 10 objects of the array for the plot.

* Reverse the array to accomodate for Plotly's horizontal bar chart defaults.

* Create a Plotly bar chart with names on the x axis and search results on the y axis. For example: 

![Greek Top Ten](../../Images/greek_top_ten.png)

## Hint 

* See the [plotly documentation](https://plotly.com/javascript/) to research how to make a bar chart horizontal.
