# Correlation Conquerors

In this activity, you’ll have an opportunity to use SciPy to compare factors across Scikit-learn's wine recognition dataset.

The wine recognition dataset includes "the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy by three different cultivators." Measurements of different constituents are taken for three types of wine.

**Note:** This dataset contains a typo ("flavanoid") that we have retained in the code to minimize confusion.

## Instructions

* Open [correlations.ipynb](Unsolved/correlations.ipynb) in the activity folder.

* Execute the starter code to import the wine recognition dataset from Scikit-learn.

* Using the dataset, plot the factors flavonoids and malic acid against each other on a scatter plot. Is this relationship positively correlated, negatively correlated, or not correlated? How strong is the correlation?

* Calculate the Pearson's correlation coefficient for  malic acid versus flavonoids. Compare the correlation coefficient to the following strength of correlation table. Was your prediction correct?

* Plot the factors color intensity versus alcohol on a scatter plot. Is this relationship positively correlated, negatively correlated, or not correlated? How strong is the correlation?

* Calculate the Pearson's correlation coefficient for alcohol versus color intensity. Compare the correlation coefficient to the Strength of Correlation table. Was your prediction correct?

## Bonus

* Review the [Pandas documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) to find how to generate a correlation matrix. This matrix will contain the Pearson correlation coefficient for all pairs of factors in the DataFrame.

* Generate the correlation matrix, and try to find the pair of factors with the strongest positive and negative correlations.
