* The below are a pandas data frame preview and a query for the total duration (in seconds) of UFO sightings by state, respectively.

  ![Images/grouby02.png](../Images/groupby02.png)

* What is an equivalent SQL query? Instead of the sum, find the mean duration by state.


## Solution

```sql
SELECT state, AVG(duration)
FROM usa_ufo
GROUP BY state;
```
