# Sentence Breaker

Now, it’s your turn to create a macro by using the `Split()` function that identifies the n-th word in a user-provided sentence. This is a challenging assignment, so take your time on it. Try to work through it piece by piece.

## Instructions

The starter workbook has a cell containing a written sentence and several cells with numbers to identify the n-th word of the sentence.

The starter code provided in `sentence_breaker.vbs` has comments to guide you.

1. Retrieve the user sentence and store it in a variable. 

2. Retrieve the user word numbers and store them in variables. 

3. Split the user sentence into separate words.

4. Use the word numbers to retrieve specific words in the sentence.
