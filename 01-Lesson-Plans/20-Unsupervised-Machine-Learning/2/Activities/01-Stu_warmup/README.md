# Warmup Activity: GridSearchCV

In this activity, you will create a grid search cross validation instance and use it to evaluate the SVC parameters (hyperparameters tuning) on the wine dataset built into Scikit-learn. 

## Instructions

The dataset you'll be working on is the wine dataset built into Scikit-learn. For each sample, there are data on traits such as color intensity, malic acid content, and magnesium content. Also available is the target column, which lists the type of wine. There are three types of wine in the dataset.

* You will perform the following tasks.

  * Split the data into training and testing sets.
  * Scale the data. See [here](https://machinelearningmastery.com/data-preparation-without-data-leakage/) for tips on avoiding data leakage.
  * Create a support vector machine model (support vector classifier) to classify a wine type based on its features.
  * Create a grid search cross-validation instance and use it to evaluate the SVC parameters (hyperparameter tuning). Feel free to use your own parameters, or use the ones provided in the notebook.
  * Predict classifications of the testing dataset.
  * Assess the accuracy score of the predicted classifications.
