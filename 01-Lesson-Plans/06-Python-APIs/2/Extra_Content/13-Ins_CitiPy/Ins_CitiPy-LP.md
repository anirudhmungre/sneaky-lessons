### 21.	Instructor Do: CitiPy	(0:05)

* As a final activity, open [13-Ins_CitiPy/Ins_CitiPy_Demo.ipynb](Solved/Ins_CitiPy_Demo.ipynb) with Jupyter Notebook and run the code.

  * Don't discuss the CitiPy API in too great of detail. Students will have to figure out its API for themselves next class.

  * Point out that this code generates a list of city names for us when provided with a list of coordinates.

* Explain that CitiPy is being utilized in the for loop to add cities for every pair of coordinates in our list.

  * Emphasize that students will be responsible for determining precisely _how_ to do this in their homework assignment as well.

* Slack out the example file and the citipy documentation (<https://github.com/wingchen/citipy>) before dismissing class.
