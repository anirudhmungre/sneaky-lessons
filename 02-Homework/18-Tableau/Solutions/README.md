## Write Up Solution

After creating and analyzing our visualizations, there were many phenomena to be uncovered.

The first being that the trips for the most used bikes are often started on or around the same stations, this may indicate that we need to increase our supply of bicycles in these areas. Adding more bikes to these stations will allow more users to have a bike available as well as preventing the same bikes from enduring heavy usage which will increase our repair fees, or worse, the risk of user injury.

Another phenomenon that was uncovered from our visualizations, is that most of our riders are between the ages of 27 and 40 with a median age of about 37. However, there are some red flags raised as it appears that we do not confirm age in any way and that the user can say they were born in any year. This was noticed when we had multiple users over 100 years old riding bikes. This is extremely unlikely and caused that data to be filtered. It may be wise to start having users validate their age so we do not have invalid data or even have underage children lying about their age to ride our bikes.

The final phenomenon that I want to recognize is that the most popular start times are at 8 AM and 6 PM. This makes sense as it is similar to when rush hour occurs. People take a bike as they are going to work in the morning and then again when they leave work in the evening. The bump around 6 PM could also be from students leaving class for the day.
