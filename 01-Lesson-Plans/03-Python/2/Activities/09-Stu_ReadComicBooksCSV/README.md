# Reading Comic Book Data

In this activity, you will create an application that searches the provided CSV file for a specific graphic novel title and then returns the title, publisher’s name, and the year it was published.

## Instructions

* Prompt the user for the book title they’d like to search.

* Search through the `comic_books.csv` to find the user's book.

* If the CSV contains the user's title, then print out the title, the publisher name, and the year it was published.

  * For example: `"Alien was published by DC Comics in 2015"`.

* If the CSV does not contain the user's title, then print out a message telling them that their book could not be found.

    * Set a variable to `False` to check if we found the comic book.

    * In the `for` loop, change the variable to confirm that the comic book is found.
