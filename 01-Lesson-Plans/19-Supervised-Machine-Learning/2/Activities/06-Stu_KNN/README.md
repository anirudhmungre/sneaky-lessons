# KNN

In this activity, you'll determine the best k value in KNN to predict diabetes for the Pima Diabetes dataset.

## Instructions

* Calculate the training and testing scores for k ranging from 1 to 20. Use only odd numbers for the k values.

* Plot the k values for both the training and the testing data to determine where the best combination of scores occurs. This point has the optimal k value for your model.

* Retrain your model by using the k value that you found to have the best scores. Print the score for this value.
