# Reddit Scraper

In this activity, you will scrape the Python Reddit for potentially interesting content. You will also have to filter for threads with twenty or more comments in them.   

## Instructions

* In this activity, you will scrape the Programmer-Humor.html file provided.

* Use Beautiful Soup to scrape only threads that have twenty or more comments, then print the thread's title, number of comments, and the URL to the thread.

## Bonus

* If you finish early, try to display each thread's top comment in your output!

* As an added bonus try re-scraping using the URL instead. What happens when you try to do this? Why might this be happening?
