# Bag and Boost

In this activity, you'll apply three aggregate classifiers to predict diabetes for the Pima Diabetes dataSet.

## Instructions

* Import a Random Forests classifier, and then fit the model to the data.

* Import an Extremely Random Trees classifier, and then fit the model to the data.

* Import an Adaptive Boosting classifier, and then fit the model to the data.

* Calculate the classification report for each model. Also, calculate the score for both the training and the testing set. Compare the performance of the three models.

## Bonus

* Refactor to reduce repetitive code. Create a function that takes in a model and a dataset and prints a classification report to compare different models.

* Choose one of the models, and then read the scikit-learn documentation. Use your newly created function to try different parameters. Can you improve the model?
