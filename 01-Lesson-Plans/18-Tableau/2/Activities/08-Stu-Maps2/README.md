# Unemployment Map

In this activity, you will further familiarize yourself with building maps with Tableau.

## Instructions

* Use `employment.csv`, a dataset constructed from the Bureau of Labor Statics data, to visualize unemployment in the United States.

* Create a map of unemployment between 2008 and 2016, by county. Which areas in the United States have been the hardest hit during that period?

* Create an unemployment map, by county, during the period 1990-1998. How does it compare and contrast with the map from 2008-16?

* Create a map of counties with the highest rates of unemployment over the whole dataset. Use Tableau's built-in census data to discover the relationship, if any, between counties with the highest rates of unemployment and the median per capita income, by county.
