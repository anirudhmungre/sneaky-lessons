# Hello, Variable World

In this activity, you will create a simple Python application that uses variables to run calculations on integers and print strings out to the console.

## Instructions

* Create two variables, called `name` and `country`, that will hold strings.

* Create two variables, called `age` and `hourly_wage`, that will hold integers.

* Create a variable called `satisfied`, which will hold a Boolean.

* Create a variable called `daily_wage`, which will hold the value of `hourly_wage` multiplied by 8.

* Use traditional string concatenation to print the `name`, `country`, `age`, and `hourly_wage` variables.

* With an `f-string`, print the `daily_wage` and `satisfied` variables.
