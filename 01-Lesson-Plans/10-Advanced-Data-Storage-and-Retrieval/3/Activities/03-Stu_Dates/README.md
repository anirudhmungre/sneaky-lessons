# Dates 

In this activity, you will practice working with dates, both in SQLAlchemy and with the `datetime` library.

## Instructions

* Use the dow.sqlite dataset provided to analyze the average stock prices (average open, average high, average low, average close) for all stocks in the Month of May.

* Plot the results as a Pandas or Matplotlib Bar Chart.

## Bonus

* Calculate the high-low peak-to-peak (PTP) values for `IBM` stock after `2011-05-31`.

* The high-low PTP is calculated using `high_price` - `low_price`.

* Use a DateTime.date object in the query filter.

* Use list comprehension to create a list of dictionaries from the query results.

* Create a dataframe from the list of dictionaries.

* Use the `boxplot()` method on the dataframe to plot PTP distribution statistics.
