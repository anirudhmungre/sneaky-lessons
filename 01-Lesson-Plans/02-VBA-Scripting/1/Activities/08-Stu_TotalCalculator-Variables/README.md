# Calculator

Now, you will have the opportunity to use data in a spreadsheet to create variables and perform a simple calculation.

## Instructions

* Using the spreadsheet and unsolved VBS code as a starter, complete the script so that `Price`, `Tax`, `Quantity`, and `Total` are stored in variables.

* Then, assign these variables the value of their associated cell in the spreadsheet.

* Once complete, your code should set the `Total` value in the spreadsheet.

* Create a pop-up message that states the total value: "Your total is $45.00."

## Bonus

Try to complete the exercise _without_ looking at the starter code.
