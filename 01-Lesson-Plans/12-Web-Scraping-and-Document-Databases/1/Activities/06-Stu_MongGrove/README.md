# Mongo Grove

In this activity, you will build a command-line interface application for the produce department of a supermarket using PyMongo to enable Python to interact with MongoDB.

## Instructions

You are the purchaser for the produce department of a large supermarket chain. You decide to use MongoDB to create a database of fruits received from your various suppliers.

* Part 1

    * Use Pymongo to create a `fruits_db` database, and a `fruits` collection.

    * Into that collection, insert two documents of fruit shipments received by your supermarket. They should contain the following information: vendor name, type of fruit, quantity received, and ripeness rating (1 for unripe, 2 for ripe, 3 for over-ripe).

* Part 2

    * Because not every supermarket employee is versed in using MongoDB, your task is to build an easy-to-use app that can be run from the console.

    * Build a Python script that asks the user for the above information, then inserts a document into a MongoDB database.

* Part 3

    * It would be good to Modify the app so that when the record is entered, the current date and time is automatically inserted into the document.

## Hint

* Consult the [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html) on the `datetime` library.
