# Looping on Through

Now, it's your chance to see how quickly we can create data using the power of a computer and `for` loops!

## Instructions

Create a `for` loop that will produce the following example. The lines signify new cells.

|  A | B  |  C |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| I will eat | 11 | Chicken Nuggets |
| I will eat | 12 | Chicken Nuggets |
| I will eat | 13 | Chicken Nuggets |
| I will eat | 14 | Chicken Nuggets |
| I will eat | 15 | Chicken Nuggets |
| I will eat | 16 | Chicken Nuggets |
| I will eat | 17 | Chicken Nuggets |
| I will eat | 18 | Chicken Nuggets |
| I will eat | 19 | Chicken Nuggets |
| I will eat | 20 | Chicken Nuggets |

## Bonus

If you finish early, consider why you may prefer using a `for` loop over the `range()` function.
