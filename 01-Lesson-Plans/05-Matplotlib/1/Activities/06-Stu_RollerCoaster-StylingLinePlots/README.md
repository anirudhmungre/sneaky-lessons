# Coaster Speed

In this activity, you will create a line chart that graphs the speed of a roller coaster over time. You will then style the chart and add aesthetics to it.

## Instructions

* Create a visualization with two line plots using the following data:

  * `Danger Drop: [9, 8, 90, 85, 80, 70, 70, 65, 55, 60, 70, 65, 50]`

  * `RailGun: [75, 70, 60, 65, 60, 45, 55, 50, 40, 40, 35, 35, 30]`

* Both coasters are 120 seconds long, and the speed was measured every 10 seconds.

* Apply styling and labels that match the image provided:

  * Title: Coaster Speed Over Time.

  * x-axis label: Coaster Runtime.

  * y-axis label: Speed (mph).

  * Red line for Danger Drop, blue line for RailGun.

  * Include a grid on the chart.
