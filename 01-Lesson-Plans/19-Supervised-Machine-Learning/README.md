# Unit 19: Supervised Machine Learning

## Overview

This week is the first of three weeks on machine learning. On the first day, we'll introduce students to machine learning concepts, and relate them to models we've already used (linear regressions and logistic regressions). The rest of the week will focus on supervised machine learning models, including classification and regression, and how to combine models with ensemble methods.

### Career Connection

Each week students will review a Career Connection document in the [04-Career-Modules folder](../../04-Career-Modules/). This Career Connection relates this week's material to a professional setting, encourages students to complete certain career-focused tasks, and provides technical interviewing questions, where applicable, that the student can work through.

**If you haven't already done so, remember to push this entire folder for students to access.**
