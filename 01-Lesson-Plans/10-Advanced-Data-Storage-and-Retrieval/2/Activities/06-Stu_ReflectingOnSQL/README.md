# Reflecting on SQL 

For this activity you test your ability to reflect existing databases using SQLAlchemy and a SQLite table focused upon demographic data.

## Instructions

* Create engine using the `demographics.sqlite` database file

* Declare a Base using `automap_base()` and use this new Base class to reflect the database's tables

* Assign the demographics table/class to a variable called `Demographics`

* Create a session and use this session to query the `Demographics` table and display the first five locations

## Bonus

* Query and print the number of unique locations in the table.

## Hint

* For the bonus, look into counting and grouping operations in SQLAlchemy
