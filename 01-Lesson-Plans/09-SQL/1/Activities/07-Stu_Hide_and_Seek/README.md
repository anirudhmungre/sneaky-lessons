In this activity, you will create a new table and import data from a CSV file.

## Instructions

* Create a new table in the `Miscellaneous_DB` database called `wordassociation`.

* Import the data from the `WordAssociation_AC.csv` file in the Resources folder.

* Create a query in which the data in the `word1` column is `stone`. 

* Create a query that collects all rows in which the author is within the range 0–10.

* Create a query that searches for any rows that have `pie` in their `word1` or `word2` columns.

## Bonus

* Import `WordAssociation_BC.csv` to the `wordassociation` table explore filtering on the `source` column.

* Create a query that will collect all rows with a `source` of BC.
