# 23.1 Final Projects

## Overview

This class will begin with an introduction to convolutional neural networks (CNN). The rest of the class will be devoted to project work.

## Class Objectives

* Students will familiarize themselves with the MNIST CNN example for handwriting recognition.

* Students will be able to load an image file into a data array.

* Students will be able to use pre-trained models to make predictions.

* Students will make measurable progress with their project work.

# Class Activities

## 1. MNIST Database

| Activity Time:       0:25 |  Elapsed Time:      0:25  |

<details>
    <summary><strong>üéâ 1.1 Everyone Do: MNIST (25 mins)</strong></summary>

* Open [01-Evr_MNIST/MNIST.ipynb](Activities/01-Evr_MNIST/Solved/MNIST.ipynb) for reference.  Slack out [01-Evr_MNIST/MNIST.ipynb](Activities/01-Evr_MNIST/Unsolved/MNIST.ipynb) and live code the solution with the students. Make sure to pause frequently to ask for questions and allow them to keep up.

  * First, explain that this activity will build deep learning model capable of recognizing handwritten digits. This is considered the `Hello World` of deep learning with many examples and tutorials available online.

  * Load the MNIST handwriting dataset from Keras.  The dataset includes 60,000 grayscale handwritten numbers.

  ![01-Evr_MNIST1](Images/01-Evr-MNIST1.png)

  * Show the first digit from the dataset using matplotlib to plot the image.

  ![01-Evr_MNIST2](Images/01-Evr-MNIST2.png)

  * Explain that these images consist of arrays of pixel values where a value of `0` represents all white while a value of `255` represents all black.

  ![01-Evr_MNIST3](Images/01-Evr-MNIST3.png)

  * The images must be reshaped from 28x28 pixels to a 1 dimensional array of 784 pixels. Imagine taking the top left and bottom right corners of our image and stretching the image out into a single array of pixels.

  ![01-Evr_MNIST4](Images/01-Evr-MNIST4.png)

  * After reshaping the pixel values, apply `MinMaxScaler`.  `MinMaxScaler` scales the data from 0 to 1.  In this example, 0 will represent all white and 1 all black.

  * Then, apply `one-hot-encoding` to the y labels. In this dataset, the labels are the digits `0-9`.  This converts the label to a binary representation of the digit (i.e. an array of `[0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]` represents the digit `5`).

  ![01-Evr_MNIST5](Images/01-Evr-MNIST5.png)

  * Finally, construct the deep learning model. For this example, use two hidden layers of 100 nodes each, and an output layer with 10 nodes (one for each digit).

  ![01-Evr_MNIST6](Images/01-Evr-MNIST6a.png)
  ![01-Evr_MNIST6](Images/01-Evr-MNIST6b.png)
  ![01-Evr_MNIST6](Images/01-Evr-MNIST6c.png)

  * Then, compile and fit the model to the data.

  ![01-Evr_MNIST6](Images/01-Evr-MNIST6d.png)
  ![01-Evr_MNIST6](Images/01-Evr-MNIST6e.png)

  * Save our trained model for later use in today's class.

  ![01-Evr_MNIST7](Images/01-Evr-MNIST7.png)

  * Show that the accuracy of the model using the test data is extremely high.

  ![01-Evr_MNIST8](Images/01-Evr-MNIST8.png)

  * Now, use the trained model to make predictions.

  * Choose a data point to predict.  `np.expand_dims` converts the input data from a shape of (,784) to (1, 784) as Keras expects.

  * Show that `model.predict()` can be used to obtain a prediction in the `one-hot-encoded` format, while `model.predict_classes()` will automatically convert from the `one-hot-encoding` to the original integer encoding.

  ![01-Evr_MNIST9](Images/01-Evr-MNIST9.png)

  * Next, import a custom image using keras.  Setting the `target_size` parameter as the image size will resize the image to be consistent with the image sizes with which the model was trained. Import it as a grayscale image.

  * Resize the image to the size the model was trained on, 28x28 pixels, and then convert the image to an array.

  ![01-Evr_MNIST10](Images/01-Evr-MNIST10.png)

  * Show that instead of `MinMaxScaler` the data is manually scaled using `image /= 255`.

  * The image data must be reshaped into a 1 dimensional array before using the model.

  ![01-Evr_MNIST11](Images/01-Evr-MNIST11.png)

  * The original data is black digits on a white backgrounds, but the custom image is inverted. Simple subtraction, `img = 1 - img`, will invert the pixels.

  ![01-Evr_MNIST12](Images/01-Evr-MNIST12.png)

  * Finally, a prediction can be made.

  ![01-Evr_MNIST13](Images/01-Evr-MNIST13.png)

  * Take some extra time to answer any questions before moving on.

    <summary><strong> üì£ 2.1 Instructor Do: Intro to Final Projects (15 mins)</strong></summary>

* **Slides:** Open the [slideshow](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VuTYTW3L-RYeK4Jb0YQlARPo1AlNgVKnsxk0-dOzsKE/edit#slide=id.g473a132ac1_0_7) and provide students with an overview of the final project and its requirements. If needed, below are talking points for the pertinent information in each slide.

* **Slides 2 - 4** Go over the schedule for the next two weeks. The provided guideline is in place to help students reach their goals without falling behind.

* **Slides 5 & 6** Requirements for this project are: finding a problem to analyze, solve, or visualize. Then, using skills picked up these last few weeks, apply machine learning to this problem. A machine learning library, such as Scikit-learn must be included, along with two of the additional components listed on the slide. Finally, the completed application must be hosted.

* **Slides 7 & 8** There are five categories in the rubric for this project: data model implementation, data model optimization, project and documentation uploaded to GitHub, the group presentation, and the slide deck.

    * Share the [Project 4 Rubric - Machine Learning Integration](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yWu9wNrva08BkK2j5L9eH1pGWMK5mtBXr5qEl0jeklw/edit?usp=sharing) with the class so they can keep a copy of the rubric locally and reference it as needed.

* **Slides 9 - 12** Use these slides to provide examples to students. Similar to previous projects, students are given the option to select from three tracks: healthcare, finance, or a custom topic.

* **Slides 13 - 15** Open the floor for any questions before placing students into groups to begin project work.
