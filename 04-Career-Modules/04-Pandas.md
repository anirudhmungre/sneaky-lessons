# Career Connection

Welcome back to another Career Connection. This week you built upon your introduction to Python by learning one of the most popular Python libraries for data science out there—Pandas. We’re excited to tell you a little more about how you might use Pandas in the workplace and how important this skill is to your future career in data.

But before we do that, let’s go ahead and boost your marketability a little bit!

1. Update your resume with your new skill set: If you haven’t already done so, add Pandas to your resume in the “Technical Skills” section. This let’s employers know that you can Panda away all day long!

Pandas has so many good uses and it is incredibly popular in data science professions. In the 2017 article “Python explosion blamed on pandas,” author Thomas Claburn discusses how the growth of Python—which we talked about last week—can be attributed almost directly to Pandas.

Give it a read and see what you think: [Python explosion blamed on pandas](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/09/14/python_explosion_blamed_on_pandas/)

Once you’re done, go ahead and move on to the technical interview preparation section!

## Technical Interview

Here are 6 important Pandas questions that every beginner should know the answer to. See if you can figure out the right answer, and jot it down in a notebook or in a text editor. Once you’re done, take a look at the solution.

- What is Python Pandas?
  - Pandas is an open-source library providing easy-to-use data analysis tools for Python.

- What are two different types of data structures in Pandas?
  - Series
  - Data frame

- What is a data series?
  - A Series is a one-dimensional labeled array which holds data of any type (integer, string, objects etc.).

- Define DataFrame in Pandas.
  - A DataFrame is a type of data structure in Pandas that works with a two-dimensional array with labeled axes (rows and columns).

- What is re-indexing in Pandas?
  - Re-indexing means to conform the DataFrame to a new index. It changes the row labels and column labels.

- How can we create a copy of a series in Pandas?

    ```py
    pandas.Series.copy
    Series.copy(deep=True)
    ```
